We state some from a general perspective, some from the perspective of the customer or sponsor, and some from the perspective of the red team. Enjoy. We add to these as the mood strikes.

			* In a Red Team operation, a perimeter asset vulnerable to SQL Injection was identified. Through this vulnerability it was possible to execute commands on the server, requiring an unusual tactic to achieve the exfiltration of the output of the commands. In this article we will explain the approach that was followed to successfully compromise this first perimeter element that was later used to pivot the internal network.

		* Executing adversary simulations in properly monitored environments allows defenders to test and enhance their detection capabilities. Unfortunately, red & purple team engagements cannot be executed too often. This talk will describe the benefits of blue team led simulations by dissecting common red team techniques, show how they can be detected and release a new tool to simulate them.

		* In this talk, we will learn about APT29 “Cozy Bear”, how they operate and what their objectives are. We will create an adversary emulation plan using C2 Matrix to pick the best command and control framework that covers the most TTPs. We will spend at least half the talk live demoing the attack with various tools that emulate the adversary behaviors and TTPs.

		* We all know that non-technical personnel (e.g. managers and executives) struggle to understand the impacts detailed in technical pentest/red team reports. But the same people have no trouble understanding the impact of a data breach. What's the difference? Well, in most red team reports, we focus on system compromise and getting domain admin rather than emulating the adversary and demonstrating what can be done with a compromise. Real attackers aren't interested in complicated exploitation techniques, they just want to get the data that pays the bills. In this talk, we'll discuss how attackers discover relevant data to target so you can more closely emulate your adversary and maximize the value of your next penetration test.

		* In collaboration with Center Participants, the Center for Threat-Informed Defense (Center) is building a library of adversary emulation plans to allow organizations to evaluate their defensive capabilities against the real-world threats they face. Emulation plans are an essential component in testing current defenses for organizations that are looking to prioritize their defenses around actual adversary behavior. Focusing our energies on developing a set of common emulation plans that are available to all means that organizations can use their limited time and resources to focus on understanding how their defenses actually fare against real-world threats.

		* Hacking Team came into the spotlight of the security industry following its damaging data breach in July 2015. The leaked data revealed several 0-day exploits being used and sold to governments, and confirmed Hacking Team’s suspected business with oppressive regimes. But what happened to Hacking Team after one of the most famous hacks of recent years?  Hacking Team’s flagship product, the Remote Control System (RCS), was detected in the wild in the beginning of 2018 in fourteen countries, including those contributing to previous criticism of the company’s practices. We will present the evidence that convinced us that the new post-hack Hacking Team samples can be traced back to a single group – not just any group – but Hacking Team’s developers themselves.  Furthermore, we intend to share previously undisclosed insights into Hacking Team’s post-leak operations, including the targeting of diplomats in Africa, uncover digital certificates used to sign the malware, and share details of the distribution vectors used to target the victims. We will compare the functionality of the post-leak samples to that in the leaked source code. To help other security researchers we’ll provide tips on how to efficiently extract details from these newer VMProtect-packed RCS samples. Finally, we will show how Hacking Team sets up companies and purchases certificates for them.

		* This article describes our experiences in helping students develop an adversary mindset byadopting the Kobayashi Maru training exercise employed in the fictional Star Trek universe.  Inthe Kobayashi Maru exercise, Starfleet cadets were faced with a no-win scenario -- attempt torescue the crew of a disabled civilian vessel, and be destroyed in the effort, or avoidconfrontation and leave the disabled ship and its crew to be captured or destroyed.  Famously,Captain Kirk won the scenario by, and this is important, stepping outside the game and alteringits rules to his benefit.  By deciding to cheat and altering the programming of the ArtificialIntelligence driving the exercise, he won the contest. Lest there be any misunderstanding, our purpose with this article is not to encourage or teachstudents to cheat in general, but to learn to think creatively when considering adversarybehavior.

		* Say red team one more time. I dare you. I double dare you. The term red team has been recently more abused than cyber. And it’s making us all hurt in ways we need dolls to point where the bad man touched us. Time to get back to business: In this talk we’ll get down and dirty on how a company can actually see a benefit from red teaming. Beyond the red team having fun and bragging rights. Actual ROI. Dirty business speak... We’ll explore some recent examples of implementing red team engagements along with good ol’e blue work, cutting the fat in the security practice of companies, and getting actionable work done.

How well do you trust the integrity of third party integrations that affect your code, your systems, and any COTS/GOTS you purchase? We will take a look at vulnerabilities that have been exploited and how they broke the perceived security of the network. Looking at the flaws in the trust chain we can see where the weaknesses are introduced and begin to devise ways to exploit them. When you're leveraging third party applications, and everyone is, you have to ask yourself `‰ÛÏDo I feel lucky?‰Û. Well, do ya, punk?`

		* The most effective way into an organization, cute cat pictures and free tickets to DerbyCon... the easiest and quickest way into an organization, attacking the weakest link, humans. There are many campaigns in the wild conveying "Cyber Security" being a shared responsibility across the organization, but how can we expect that when we do not prepare our fellow employees? We need to properly prepare our employees, managers, technical folk, and even the Executives for the security battle ground. Militaries do not train their generals, sergeants, and ground soldiers with the same material and techniques, and neither should we for security awareness training. Join us and an old friend, Sun Tzu, to prepare the war and battles we are facing from all sides of our organization.
	* [Planning Effective Red Team Exercises - Sean T Malone - BSidesSF2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD-jKBfSKP4)
		* An effective red team exercise is substantially different from a penetration test, and it should be chartered differently as well. The scenario, objective, scope, and rules of engagement all need to be positioned correctly at the beginning in order to most closely simulate a real adversary and provide maximum value to the client.In this presentation, we'll review best practices in each of these areas, distilled from conducting dozens of successful red team exercises - along with some war stories highlighting why each element matters. Those in offensive security will gain an understanding of how to manage the client's expectations for this process, and how to guide them towards an engagement that provides a realistic measurement of their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to real attacks. Those in enterprise security will gain a deeper understanding of this style of assessment, and how to work with a red team to drive real improvement in their security programs.

		* How does one build an enterprise red team from scratch? That was the question I faced a year ago when I accepted the lead red team engineer role at Palo Alto Networks. The most apparent lesson for me has been that red teaming as an internal enterprise function draws an interpretation that is quite different from the one generally accepted by the industry. Over the last year, I have had to set aside everything I thought I knew about red teaming and build an approach that offered the value proposition an enterprise is looking for from such a function. In the first part of this session, I want to touch upon the lessons I have learned during my journey to build a red team program. I want to share my thoughts on the philosophy and approach that is most likely to benefit an enterprise program like this. While this might seem very academic, this has governed every single tactical piece the team has had to implement to make the program a success. Not only has the team composition and interactions been heavily governed by the approach, we have also built custom tools and frameworks to operationalize it. The success we have seen so far is what has prompted me to share highlights of the program with a wider audience. Hopefully, I can help someone else struggling with the same question I faced above. The story, however, doesn’t end there, because building a red team program was only half the battle. I’m sure at least some of the attendees have read (with or without scoffing) about the purple teaming movement. While, in theory, it absolutely should resonate with any enterprise security engineer, putting it in practice is a different matter. The second part of the session will focus on approaches and mechanisms to adopt purple teaming. By the end of this session, the audience should expect to walk away with concrete ideas on approaches to implementing enterprise red team and purple team programs.

		* Red Teaming is currently the closest most companies get to adversary emulation. While Red Teaming can do a good job pointing out security gaps, blind spots, and human weaknesses within an organization, there are also limitations. Engagement SOW’s, timelines, and laws impose limitations which can unwittingly push a Red Team engagement far from adversary emulation. Some thoughts on the current status quo, and ways to mix it up.

		* Leave your 0days, leave your latest hacks behind AND bring your playbook for the blue team. We have more hacks and more works, trojans and attack vectors than we know what to do with, therefore what DO we actually do with them, THAT IS the question on the "tech behind" track'this is not about how you attach it is ALL about how you defend. What happens when the midden hits the fan, how and where and why do you react, how do you even know that you have been hacked? As security we have failed our very charges, we continue to allow them to be attacked and we fail at defense, therefore bring your BEST technical minds and apply them to how we better protect those that rely upon us.

		* Moving from a large company with a retinue of pentesters, to a start-up with far fewer resources, can be a strain. It may be just you. While you're performing services, your new company may also need you to be flexible -- move to supporting some IR or blue team-related functionality. You won't be able to do both sides of a purple team, but you can help things meet for your clients.

		* Red teaming requires the use of specialized tools. However, this should not exclude operators from using the same technology, adhering to the same procedures, and following the same policies as their colleagues throughout the organization. Some argue that this will prevent operators from executing on their duties. The contrary is true. With a few exceptions in place and thoughtful architecture considerations, treating red teamers as regular employees will improve their testing and reduce the risk that red teamers bring to organizations.

		* [Slides](https://tacticaladversary.io/slides/Internal-Red-Team-BSides-Delhi-2020-Abhijith-b-r.pdf)
		* This talk is about building a practical internal #redteam​. This is not an easy task. For organizations, it is essential to have an internal offensive team to continuously perform adversarial simulation to strengthen the security posture and enhance blue team capabilities. Many variables needs to be taken care of before going forward with such an initiative. Most important thing would be assessing the progress and maturity of the red team building process.

This talk will examine the actions that separate high-performing red teams from the competition. The speakers will share practical red team methods developed through their careers as offensive security consultants, along with insights from leaders in the infosec industry. They’ll connect observations from recent publications on the topic with the lessons learned from their previous careers on other high-performing, high-stress teams -- one as a Marine and the other as a professional baseball player.  This talk will highlight how effective teams are architected, the challenges of remote work, engagement planning and execution, practical tips for effective communication, and the importance of team cohesion when pursuing a mission. Attendees will walk away with action items they can take back to their organizations and start implementing immediately.

			* "Guerrilla Red Team is a methodology by which a company can grow security IQ, technical expertise, and security brainpower, resulting in an internal mesh network of trusted decentralized ethical hackers. The program requires minimal capital investment from the hosting red team. It achieves its primary goals through weekly group mentorship hosted during a four-hour block, once per week, during the workday. It forms a peer network in which guerrilla operators share ideas and techniques, and ultimately grow technically and professionally as a unit. Members of the program come from various technical disciplines, but not necessarily security-focused verticals. The cohort of five to six members follows a nine-week syllabus that takes them from someone with minimal red team experience to autonomous operations. Guerrilla Operators will have a regular cadence of operations, which will require deconfliction from the parent red team to only ensure there are no safety concerns with the proposed target. Expected outcomes for the nine-week cohort are as follows: Guerrilla operators are armed with the skills to continue their red team learning, as well as a support network for challenging tasks The parent red team has an expanded network of internal, trusted, ethical hackers. This strengthens idea generation for campaigns, and enables communication through the use of a shared and common technical language. Over time, the Guerrilla Red Team provides a steady flow of trained homegrown red team operators or security analysts The company itself benefits by having security-focused mindsets placed throughout technical disciplines, resulting in staff that are poised to ward off attacks by thinking like an attacker, functioning similarly to security-focused Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) Provides the company with verification that their security program and infrastructure are as robust as they say it is through the use of decentralized, independent low-tier actors attacking the network: an Offsec ChaosMonkey Provides the guerrilla operators real world, hands on experience in a career field that is hard to break into outside of the Federal pipeline "

			* Red Teams can be obsessed with OPSEC because it enables us to deliver impactful results. However, when operational security becomes unchecked secrecy, it can confuse or even offend our peers. A security organization that trusts and understands each other will perform better. If you have ever been asked “Why can’t you just tell me your TTPs?” this talk will help you explain the whats, whys, and whens of OPSEC and help you evaluate when to let others in on your closely guarded secrets. Instead of discussing tips and tricks to hack better, this talk aims to shed light on an area of Red Teaming that walks the line between strategy and the Red to Blue relationship. How does OPSEC enable Red Teams to deliver a more useful assessment? There are Common questions that Red Teams deflect answering, citing OPSEC. This talk will challenge your response to these questions, asking where OPSEC is helping or hurting your specific security mission, and help you justify and explain your decisions. Learn from the real triumphs and pitfalls of GE's Red Team’s experience to improve your own OPSEC strategy.

			* "In this thesis,a Unified Kill Chain(UKC)modelis developedthat focuses on the tactics that form the consecutive phases of cyber attacks(Table 1). Ahybrid research approach is used to develop the UKC,combiningdesign science with qualitative research methods. The UKC is first developed through literature study, extendingthe CKC by uniting improvements that were previously proposed by other authors withthe tactics of MITRE’s ATT&CK™model. The UKC is subsequently iteratively evaluatedand improved through case studies of attacksby Fox-IT’s Red Team and APT28(alias Fancy Bear). The resulting UKC is a meta model that supports the development of end-to-end attack specific kill chains and actor specific kill chains, that can subsequently be analyzed, compared and defended against."

			* Are you looking to rapidly improve your security posture or train a new member of your security organization? Are you a Blue Team member looking to cross train with Red Team or vice versa? Purple Teaming could be the answer to your problems. You may have already heard about Purple Teaming through a spare think piece online, casual mentions or even rage tweets, but few know what makes a Purple Team. In this talk I will cover how to build your own Purple Team function from the ground up using applied gap analysis, creating meaningful test cases, modifying tools, cross-training possibilities, and automation frameworks. We'll walk through the methodology together so you leave with the tools and experience you need to do it yourself. If implemented, this can give you a better knowledge of your security baseline, improvements in defenses, opportunities for internal training and mentorship, and an increased dialogue between Red and Blue.

			* This talk is about the Attack Team Automation Tool (ATAT). ll3nigmall wrote this tool to create repeatability and increase efficiency in large scale penetration tests. Are you feeling Vader's impending choke hold when large scopes are handed down with numerous targets and a large number of duplicate exploits to be handled across several disparate targets? Do you receive incomplete vulnerability reports from Qua..I mean, your vulnerability scanners that require you to identify which port each target has the identified service running on? Does your team have to accomplish high volume and high value repeatable penetration tests with industry standard tools at a fraction of the time it would normally take? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, maybe, or just a defeated; then it is time to fire up your brand new ATAT and charge those shield generators like Greedo in a speedo! Yeah, I'm not really sure what that last line was supposed to mean either. Just git clone ATAT. You'll see what I mean! :)

			* The days of the IOC are over, and now defenders need to detect the behaviors of an adversary. The best way to do this is for red and blue to operate together in a purple team with many quicker engagements. By leveraging threat intelligence and the common language of ATT&CK, red teams can behave like very specific adversaries while providing a breadth of technique implementations. A successful purple team occurs when red helps blue find gaps in sensing, helps create analytics, and can perform many different implementations of the same behaviors. To share this process and jumpstart others, MITRE is releasing initial ATT&CK emulation plans for APT3 and APT29, complete with adversary MO and a ‘cheat sheet’ of potential commands for red teams.

			* The MITRE ATT&CK framework is all the rage these days. Many are looking at this as a research framework that can help standardize many aspects of information security, particularly with respect to offensive methodology. This talk will look at the MITRE ATT&CK framework from a different angle aby examining how the information MITRE has organized can improve penetration testing and, based on preliminary results, defensive posture. I will provide an overview of the ATT&CK framework, discuss the techniques that are useful for penetration testing, and present a case study of homebrew malware written to be aligned with the ATT&CK Framework. The talk will conclude with a discussion of using existing tools aligned with MITRE's ATT&CK Framework for detection and automating analysis of log data generated by those tools. It is important to note that this talk as supported by a significant amount of student work through both undergraduate and graduate capstone projects.

			* Given the increasing awareness and use of the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix as a common language between Red Teams, Blue Teams, and executives, a growing number of organizations are utilizing the framework in inappropriate ways. This talk will provide the audience with a very fast yet very practical overview of ATT&CK, as well as how it is being utilized well and not so well in the industry. From periodic tables to minesweeper, and from CALDERA to Atomic Red Team, we will go over a list of the do’s and don’ts to get the most value from the ATT&CK matrix.

			* C3CM: the acronym for command- control- and communi - cations countermeasures. Ripe for use in the information security realm, C3CM takes us past C2 analysis and to the next level. Initially, C3CM was most often intended to wreck the command and control of enemy air defense networks, a very specific military mission. We-ll apply that mindset in the context of combating bots and other evil. Our version of C3CM therefore is to identify, interrupt, and counter the command, control, and communications capabilities of our digital assailants. The three phases of C3CM will utilize: Nfsight with Nfdump, Nfsen, and fprobe to conduct our identification phase, Bro with Logstash and Kibana for the interruption phase, and ADHD for the counter phase. Converge these on one useful platform and you too might have a chance deter those who would do you harm. We-ll discuss each of these three phases (identify, interrupt, and counter) with tooling and tactics, complete with demonstrations and methodology attendees can put to use in their environments.

	* **Tools**	
		* [Callback Catcher](https://bitbucket.org/gavinanders/callback-catcher/src/master/)
			* Callback Catcher is a multi-socket control tool designed to aid in pentest activities. It has a simple web application with an backend API that allows the user control what TCP and UDP sockets should be opened on the server. It records any and all data send to the exposed sockets and logs it to a database which can be easily accessed via it's backend API. Itís kind of intended to be like the love child of Burp Collaborator and Responder. Alternatively think of it like a low/medium interactive honeypot. Its been coded on top of the Django REST framework, which offers a number of benefits , primarily being able to create your own client scripts and tools and quickly searching and filtering of data. Opening of sockets is built on top of Python's ServerSocket library. Upon spinning up a socket a user is given the option to assign a handler to the socket, which is affectively user defined code that overwrites the handler function within the SocketServer.TCPServer and SocketServer.UDPServer classes. This code tells the socket how to handle the incoming data and what to respond with. Each connection to the socket is recorded to a database.

		* [emptynest](https://github.com/empty-nest/emptynest)
			* Emptynest is a plugin based C2 server framework. The goal of this project is not to replace robust tools such as Empire, Metasploit, or Cobalt Strike. Instead, the goal is to create a supporting framework for quickly creating small, purpose built handlers for custom agents. No agent is provided. Users of Emptynest should create their own agents that implement minimal functionality and can be used to evade detection and establish a more robust channel. An example of an agent might support Unhooking, DLL Unloading, and code execution. Due to the simple nature of this project, it is recommended that agents be kept private.
		* [RemoteRecon](https://github.com/xorrior/RemoteRecon)
			* RemoteRecon provides the ability to execute post-exploitation capabilities against a remote host, without having to expose your complete toolkit/agent. Often times as operator's we need to compromise a host, just so we can keylog or screenshot (or some other miniscule task) against a person/host of interest. Why should you have to push over beacon, empire, innuendo, meterpreter, or a custom RAT to the target? This increases the footprint that you have in the target environment, exposes functionality in your agent, and most likely your C2 infrastructure. An alternative would be to deploy a secondary agent to targets of interest and collect intelligence. Then store this data for retrieval at your discretion. If these compromised endpoints are discovered by IR teams, you lose those endpoints and the information you've collected, but nothing more.
		* [Nuages](https://github.com/p3nt4/Nuages)
			* Nuages aims at being a C2 framework in which back end elements are open source, whilst implants and handlers must be developed ad hoc by users. As a result, it does not provide a way to generate implants, but an open source framework to develop and manage compatible implants that can leverage all the back end resources already developed.

				* C3 (Custom Command and Control) is a tool that allows Red Teams to rapidly develop and utilise esoteric command and control channels (C2). It's a framework that extends other red team tooling, such as the commercial Cobalt Strike (CS) product via ExternalC2, which is supported at release. It allows the Red Team to concern themselves only with the C2 they want to implement; relying on the robustness of C3 and the CS tooling to take care of the rest. This efficiency and reliability enable Red Teams to operate safely in critical client environments (by assuring a professional level of stability and security); whilst allowing for safe experimentation and rapid deployment of customised Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). Thus, empowering Red Teams to emulate and simulate an adaptive real-world attacker.

			* Web technologies continue to progress and with that brings an abundance of new protocols that aim to increase internet traffic efficiency and security. This introduces new capabilities into web browser which in-turn requires security tools and process to adapt for effective handling, monitoring, or detection. The TCP based HTTP/2 and the UDP based HTTP/3 protocols are two of the newer protocols that are used by major web browsers and could exist on your network. In this talk we'll do a walkthrough of Merlin, a post-exploitation Command and Control (C2) tool written in Go that leverages these protocols for Command and Control (C2) traffic. The presentation will go through an introduction to the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocols along with other unique Merlin capabilities such as the OPAQUE key exchange, encrypted JSON Web Tokens, and dynamic JA3 client hash modification.

			* Ninja C2 is an Open source C2 server created by Purple Team to do stealthy computer and Active directoty enumeration without being detected by SIEM and AVs , Ninja still in beta version and when the stable version released it will contains many more stealthy techniques and anti-forensic to create a real challenge for blue team to make sure all the defenses configured correctly and they can detect sophisticated attacks. Ninja use python to server the payload and control the agents . the agents are based on C# and powershell which can bypass leading AVs . Ninja comunicate with the agents in secure channel encrpyted with AES-256 and the key is not hard coded but randomly generated on the campaign start , every agent connect to the C2 get the key and if the C2 restarted a new key will be used by all old agents and the new. Ninja also randomize the callback URLs for every campaign to bypass static detection.

It will use a range of methods to evade EDR and AV while allowing the operator to continue using tooling an tradecraft they are familiar with. Its powered by Python 3.8 and C, using Donut for payload generation. By using Donut along side the process injection capabilities of SHAD0W it gives the operator the ability to execute .NET assemblies, EXEs, DLLs, VBS, JS or XSLs fully inside memory. Dynamically resolved syscalls are heavily used to avoid userland API hooking, anti DLL injection to make it harder for EDR to load code into the beacons and offical microsoft mitigation methods to protect spawn processes.

			* When organizations choose to isolate networks, they often choose to implement technologies like private VLANs, use separate hosts and hypervisors and maybe even separate physical locations in order to guarantee the isolation. But what if these separated environments share the same Active Directory environment? It's not hard to come up with ideas why this might seem like a good idea, however, it also provides an opportunity to exchange data over LDAP. After all, even in non-Windows environments LDAP is still used as a central node within the network. During this talk I will go into detail about the process of designing & building a stealth C2 LDAP channel, which makes communication between different strictly firewalled network segments possible.

			* [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dimas050/foxtrot-c2-a-journey-of-payload-delivery)
			* Execution of an offensive payload may begin with a safe delivery of the payload to the endpoint itself. When secure connections in the enterprise are inspected, reliance only on transmission level security may not be enough to accomplish that goal. Foxtrot C2 serves one goal: safe last mile delivery of payloads and commands between the external network and the internal point of presence, traversing intercepting proxies, with the end-to-end application level encryption. While the idea of end-to-end application encryption is certainly not new, the exact mechanism of Foxtrot's delivery implementation has advantages to Red Teams as it relies on a well known third party site, enjoying elevated ranking and above average domain fronting features. Payload delivery involves several OpSec defenses: sensible protection from direct attribution, active link expiration to evade consistent interception, inspection, tracking and replay activities by the defenders. Asymmetric communication channels will also be used. And if your standalone Foxtrot agent is caught, the delivery mechanism may live on, you could still manually bring the agent back into the environment via the browser. A concept tool built on these ideas will be presented and released. It will be used as basis for our discussion.

			* From the venerable bind shell, to the reverse shell, the IRC bot channel, the icmp/dns/custom UDP tunnel, and the asynchronous HTTP C&C server, remote access has taken many forms since we first began remotely exploiting software. Even today, many traditional methods will still frequently bypass firewalls and detection, and additional methods continue to be devised. But as an attacker, what do I do when my favorite method is blocked? What are my options other than reusing a stale python script from github or creating my own ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of a high-level messaging protocol? And as a defender, how can I measure my ability to detect the diverse C&C traffic that may be seen today, and also prepare for new and unexpected channels? In this talk, we will discuss the evolution of command and control methods, their strengths and weaknesses from an attacker's perspective, and the capabilities of a defender to detect and respond to them. We will identify what aspects a forward-thinking C&C framework might require, and then demonstrate a proof-of-concept with 99(ish) different interchangeable methods for communication. Finally, we will discuss some of the shortcomings of egress filtering in enterprise environments that should be addressed in order to mature our detection and response in kind.

			* The popularity of third party chat applications is on the rise for both personal and enterprise use. They provide the ability to send brief messages similar to previously popular platforms such as ICQ, AIM, and even IRC. However, one of the main reasons they are being adopted is due to their functionality and cost. The challenge is that these same benefits are attracting cybercriminals to the services.   Cybercriminals are utilizing legitimate chat services as command and control channels to facilitate malicious activity. To achieve this, actors are using the platforms’ API services to integrate custom applications within the chat platforms. On most of these platforms, “bots” are automated scripts that are running on a remote machine to provide integrated information, including anything from a cat fact and meme creation, to running OS commands. The APIs allow for flexibility to listen for an action and then perform a task based on the information. Threat actors are taking notice of this and utilizing API functions for command and control. This talk will delve into the API functions, and how malware and cybercriminals are utilizing these functions as command and control capabilities. Attendees will understand how to identify, mitigate and prevent such communications from happening in their own organizations.

			* It’s no surprise that attackers repurpose legitimate cloud services for malicious use, such as command and control. Defenders are also aware of this shift and have spent their time researching this move to build better defenses. As such, attackers are forced to innovate.  Azure Functions is Microsoft’s entry into “server-less code”. Beyond developing code that can run anywhere in the cloud, it provides users with the ability to trigger arbitrary code execution that performs any task you’ve developed, including proxying communications. We’re going to look at how Azure Functions can be leveraged by security professionals, and attackers, for command and control.  This talk will dive into two methods for establishing command and control communications while leveraging the cloud to control compromised systems.

			* The purpose of this tool is to provide a protocol independent framework that contains a base set of features that can piggyback on top of any collaborative web platform or service. The base docClient and docServer are meant to be extended upon with Buffer classes written for individual web services. These buffer classes can be plugged into the MurDock framework in order to create a unique shell infrastructure that will always contains a base set of features, as well as the ability to tunnel over any web application traffic for which a buffer class has been constructed. The framework can be extended to operate over lower level protocols if desired.

			* Domain fronting, the technique of circumventing internet censorship and monitoring by obfuscating the domain of an HTTPS connection was killed by major cloud providers in April of 2018. However, with the arrival of TLS 1.3, new technologies enable a new kind of domain fronting. This time, network monitoring and internet censorship tools are able to be fooled on multiple levels. This talk will give an overview of what domain fronting is, how it used to work, how TLS 1.3 enables a new form of domain fronting, and what it looks like to network monitoring. You can circumvent censorship and monitoring today without modifying your tools using an open source TCP and UDP pluggable transport tool that will be released alongside this talk.

			* Each of us only memorizes a few passwords. Most of your company's employees don't use password managers. Sites get breached. These three statements mean attackers can often get your employees' passwords from other sites (like LinkedIn) and re-use them against your organization to walk in the front door. This talk will define credential stuffing, walk through an example realistic attack, then discuss how you can safely check your own company's exposure and eliminate this risk.

The purpose of the talk is to do more then get up and say i built this thing and it does this, but instead to have a conversation about the process of fast proto-typing and to encourage others that may or may not have an idea to try building something themselves, and create their own DIY evolution!

			* Abstract: In this paper we propose an extremely stealthy approach for implementing hardware Trojans below the gate level, and we evaluate their impact on the security of the target device. Instead of adding additional circuitry to the target design, we insert our hardware Trojans by changing the dopant polarity of existing transistors. Since the modied circuit ap- pears legitimate on all wiring layers (including all metal and polysilicon), our family of Trojans is resistant to most detection techniques, including negrain optical inspection and checking against \golden chips". We demonstrate the e ectiveness of our approach by inserting Trojans into two designs | a digital post-processing derived from Intel's cryptographically secure RNG design used in the Ivy Bridge processors and a side-channel resistant SBox implementation | and by exploring their detectability and their effects on security.
		* [Implementation and Implications of a Stealth Hard-Drive Backdoor](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/kurmus/papers/acsac13.pdf) 
			* Modern workstations and servers implicitly trust hard disks to act as well-behaved block devices. This paper analyzes the catastrophic loss of security that occurs when hard disks are not trustworthy. First, we show that it is possible to compromise the firmware of a commercial ovt-the-shelf hard drive, by resorting only to public information and reverse engineering. Using such a compromised firmware, we present a stealth rootkit that replaces arbitrary blocks from the disk while they are written, providing a data replacement back- door . The measured performance overhead of the compromised disk drive is less than 1% compared with a normal, non-malicious disk drive. We then demonstrate that a re- mote attacker can even establish a communication channel with a compromised disk to infiltrate commands and to ex-filtrate data. In our example, this channel is established over the Internet to an unmodified web server that relies on the compromised drive for its storage, passing through the original webserver, database server, database storage engine, filesystem driver, and block device driver. Additional experiments, performed in an emulated disk-drive environment, could automatically extract sensitive data such as /etc/shadow (or a secret key le) in less than a minute. This paper claims that the diffculty of implementing such an at- tack is not limited to the area of government cyber-warfare; rather, it is well within the reach of moderately funded criminals, botnet herders and academic researchers.

Three USB devices that can be used to launch an attack will be compared: a "rubber ducky", the WHID Injector device and the USBNinja cable. We will present the results of forensic analyses performed on corporate computers after our Redteam launched attacks using the previously introduced USB devices. We will focus on the traces left by these devices at the operating system level (event logs of interest, USB traces ...) and the data exfiltration techniques that can be used during this type of attack. We will introduce a principle of hardware investigation and how to locate interface pinout to try to dump the content of the suspicious device to analyse its “malicious” capabilities.

PhanTap is silent in the network and does not affect the victim’s traffic, even in networks having NAC (Network Access Control 802.1X - 2004). PhanTap will analyze traffic on the network and mask its traffic as the victim device. It can mount a tunnel back to a remote server, giving the user a foothold in the network for further analysis and pivoting. PhanTap is an OpenWrt package and should be compatible with any device. The physical device used for our testing is currently a small, inexpensive router, the GL.iNet GL-AR150.

TAP was designed to make the deployment of these boxes super simple and create a self-healing and stable platform to deploy remote penetration testing platforms. Essentially the concept is simple, you pre-configure a brand new box and run the TAP setup file. This will install a service on Linux that will be configured the way you want. What it will do is establish a reverse SSH tunnel back to a machine thats exposed on the Internet for you. From there you can access the box locally from the server it connects back to. TAP automatically detects when an SSH connection has gone stale and will automatically rebuild it for you.

			* Traditionally, the answer to this question has been to execute an attack technique in a controlled environment and to observe relevant events that surface. While this approach may suffice in some cases, ask yourself the following questions: ?Will this scale? Will this detect current/future variants of the technique? Is this resilient to bypass?? If your confidence level in answering these questions is not high, it?s time to consider a more mature methodology for identifying detection data sources. With a little bit of reverse engineering, a defender can unlock a multitude of otherwise unknown telemetry. This talk will establish a methodology for identifying detection data sources and will cover concepts including Event Tracing for Windows, WPP, TraceLogging, and security product analysis.

	 	* [Using blue team techniques in red team ops - Mark Bergman & Marc Smeets(BruCON 0x0A)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjtftdPts4g)
			* When performing multi-month, multi-C2teamserver and multi-scenario red team operations, you are working with an infrastructure that becomes very large quickly. This makes it harder to keep track of what is happening on it. Coupled with the ever-increasing maturity of blue teams, this makes it more likely the blue team is somewhere analysing parts of your infra and/or artefacts. In this presentation we’ll show you how you can use that to your advantage. We’ll present different ways to keep track of the blue team’s analyses and detections, and to dynamically adjust your infra to fool the blue team. We will first set the scene by explaining common and lesser known components of red teaming infrastructures, e.g. dynamic redirectors, domain fronting revisited, decoy websites, html-smuggling, etc. Secondly, we’ll show how to centralize all your infrastructure’s and ops’ information to an ELK stack, leaving it open for intelligent querying across the entire infrastructure and operation. This will also help with better feedback to the blue team at the end of the engagement. Lastly, we’ll dive into novel ways of detecting a blue team’s investigation and we’ll give examples on how to react to these actions, for example by creating honeypots for the blue team.

			* Malware signature detectors use patterns of bytes, orvariations of patterns of bytes, to detect malware attemptingto enter a systems. This approach assumes the signaturesare both or sufficient length to identify the malware, andto distinguish it from non-malware objects entering the sys-tem. We describe a technique that can increase the difficultyof both to an arbitrary degree. This technique can exploitan optimization that many anti-virus systems use to makeinserting the malware simple; fortunately, this particularexploit is easy to detect, provided the optimization is notpresent. We describe some experiments to test the effective-ness of this technique in evading existing signature-basedmalware detectors.

			* This talk is an encapsulation of implemented solutions for achieving common requirements when constructing software designed to perform long term covert intelligence gathering. It is a “grab bag” of “tips and tricks” developed and or abstracted from previous works by the presenter in a variety of intelligence gathering operations, none of which will be specifically disclosed. Full source code (almost all of it written in Golang) will be provided for tactic snippets, as well as several publicly available practical examples of solutions to various covert intelligence gathering roadblocks.  The technical details of this presentation will be prefaced by a small summery of “which tactics work from a methodical perspective and why” from a human perspective. Beyond this, specific mappings will be drawn from these methods to the specific technical capabilities disclosed in the latter portion of the presentation. The technical subjects in question will include but not be limited to. – anti virus evasion (with special emphasis on modern machine learning based solutions) – anti attribution techniques – covert channel methods – C2 “castle guarding” – covert administration & devops – solution scaling – persistence – future proofing – counter intelligence / anti reverse engineering.

			* Chances are there are a few things we all know about PowerShell. It’s great, it’s nearly ubiquitous on Windows, and we can get up to some crazy red team shenaniganry with it. One shouldn’t necessarily be judged if their knowledge of PowerShell ends there. After all, the information security space is far too vast for everyone to know everything. That said, we’re in a dangerous spot. So much thought space seems to be dedicated to matching pre-fabricated tools with pre-defined scenarios akin to the script kiddie methodology of yesteryear. We don’t need to be an expert on everything, but something that has become as core as PowerShell should at least warrant a little bit of study. To that end, we’ll walk through creation, execution, and persistence of a few basic implant prototypes written in PowerShell for Windows. Along the way we’ll look at a few different notes and techniques for coding, packaging, and execution within the contexts of detectability and mitigation. The talk will focus on practical instruction and key gimmies and gotchas. By the end of the discussion, the audience is expected to have a better understanding about how PowerShell tools are written an executed, leading to a greater command over existing tools and techniques. With a bit of additional study, the audience should be able to author tools of their own.
		* [Malproxying: Leave Your Malware at Home - Hila Cohen, Amit Waisel(Defcon27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZx0oJU1nI)
			* During a classic cyber attack, one of the major offensive goals is to execute code remotely on valuable machines. The purpose of that code varies on the spectrum from information extraction to physical damage. As defenders, our goal is to detect and eliminate any malicious code activity, while hackers continuously find ways to bypass the most advanced detection mechanisms. It’s an endless cat-and-mouse game where new mitigations and features are continuously added to the endpoint protection solutions and even the OS itself in order to protect the users against newly discovered attack techniques. In this talk, we present a new approach for malicious code to bypass most of endpoint protection measures. Our approach covertly proxies the malicious code operations over the network, never deploying the actual malicious code on the victim side. We are going to execute code on an endpoint, without really storing the code on disk or loading it to memory. This technique potentially allows attackers to run malicious code on remote victims, in such a way that the code is undetected by the victim’s security solutions. We denote this technique as “malproxying”.

			* Over the last years, the cyber security posture of companies is improving, and, despite the general opinion, anti-viruses and endpoint protections are more and more sophisticated against “day-to-day threats”. Additionally, defenders are better trained and more aware of the techniques, tactics and procedures (TTPs) used by the bad guys, which subsequently make them readier to detect and respond to incoming threats. The two objectives of this presentation are (i) to define the numerous challenges faced while building and deploying malwares nowadays, and (ii) to provide a non-exhaustive list of techniques and tactics that can be implement in order to bypass defence mechanisms.

					* We observe that as the fidelity and transparency of dynamicmalware analysis systems improves, malware authors can resortto other system characteristics that are indicative of artificialenvironments. We present a novel class of sandbox evasiontechniques that exploit the “wear and tear” that inevitably occurson real systems as a result of normal use. By moving beyond howrealistic a system looks like, to how realisticits past uselooks like,malware can effectively evade even sandboxes that do not exposeany instrumentation indicators, including bare-metal systems. Weinvestigate the feasibility of this evasion strategy by conductinga large-scale study of wear-and-tear artifacts collected from realuser devices and publicly available malware analysis services. Theresults of our evaluation are alarming: using simple decision treesderived from the analyzed data, malware can determine that asystem is an artificial environment and not a real user devicewith an accuracy of 92.86%. As a step towards defending againstwear-and-tear malware evasion, we develop statistical models thatcapture a system’s age and degree of use, which can be used toaid sandbox operators in creating system images that exhibit arealistic wear-and-tear state.

Our solution fixes all the above problems: Firstly, it can recognize all the available OS variants and (in lots of cases) exact OS versions with excellent accuracy, regardless of OS tweaking. Secondly, UFO is extremely fast. Last but not least, it is hypervisor-independent: we proved that by implementing UFO for Xen and Hyper-V.

It's a native code, optimizing compiler that fits in about 5KB of shellcode, requires no runtime environment, can be deployed any way you like, and yet gives you all the access you need on the target host. And to top it all off, it's built around an interactive coding paradigm that makes dynamic exploratory post-exploitation fun. This talk approaches some complex topics, but is designed to be interesting to anyone, whether you're into compiler theory or not. Even a non-coder should get something out of it, so anyone with an interest in offensive hacking is encouraged to attend.

					* With all of the defenses Microsoft has implemented in the PowerShell run-time over the past few years Red Teamers & APT groups have started too shy away from using PowerShell based payloads/delivery mechanisms and migrate over to C#. However, C# is a compiled language, operationally this has a few major downsides: we can?t be as ?flexible? as we could be with scripting languages, setting up a proper development environment has overhead, things need to be compiled etc... in this talk, I will be covering my approach to solving these operational problems by using some of the (possibly?) lesser known features of the .NET framework and introducing BYOI (Bring Your Own Interpreter) payloads which allow you to embed a scripting language of your choosing into any .NET language!

				* [Slides](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-17/dc-17-presentations/defcon-17-sean_taylor-binary_obfuscation.pdf)
				* Binary obfuscation is commonly applied in malware and by software vendors in order to frustrate the efforts of reverse engineers to understand the underlying code. A common misconception is one must be a master of assembly in order to properly obfuscate a binary. However, with knowledge of compiler optimizations and certain keywords, one can frustratingly obfuscate their binary simply by writing specifically crafted high-level code. This talk will attempt to teach an array of methods that can be employed to obfuscate a binary as it is compiled rather than afterward. Knowledge of C/C++ is the only prerequisite for this talk.

				* Many times the answer to any question about cryptography is: "never roll your own crypto". While the logic behind this is understandable it has become a bit of a lost art. Despite the fact that for the most part standard crypto used in normal situations works; when trying to hide the existence of encrypted data alltogether it is far from an optimal solution. Most modern crypto is designed with the fact that the evesdropper knows that an encrypted message exists. However these days with ssl proxys, reversing antivirus, and "anti-crypto" law proposals the assumption that having an evesdropper knowing the existence of said crypto is no longer an easy concession. Despite the fact of many "next-gen" antiviruses failing to detect many obfuscation methods using algorithms such as AES for encrypting a payload is the WRONG way. The reason they are not detected is such an antivirus is just not looking for traces of such an algorithm. From a forensics standpoint, if you're using AES the private key is on the victim's machine for example. In addition, the permutations or S-Boxes are well known permutations and easy to spot in your algorithm. This talk will be on how to design algorithms to make the existence of the cryptography unknown. We will keep some of it high level but also show how to properly implement your own cryptography and/or steganography in such a way that the evesdropper doesn't know it exists. We will talk about side channels and how to keep out of band and/or homemade crypto "cryptographically strong" but also how to generate it on the fly so that no only can you encrypt data in side channels, you can generate a new algorithm on the fly. We want to make it so the randomness of the algorithm itself is "cryptographically strong" Even though many next-gen antivirus fails at such detection as it inproves we need to study obfuscation as much as the mathematics and/or science of standard cryptography.

				* We present malWASH, a dynamic diversification engine that executes an arbitrary program without being detected by dynamic analysis tools. Target programs are chopped into small components that are then executed in the context of other processes, hiding the behavior of the original program in a stream of benign behavior of a large number of processes. A scheduler connects these components and transfers state between the different processes. The execution of the benign processes is not impacted. Furthermore, malWASH ensures that the executing program remains persistent, complicating the removal process.

That's right, you won't have to write any C++ (but you will need to compile it), but you will benefit from your shellcode being custom encrypted in unmanaged code. It is a basic stream cipher which is implemented as, fundamentally, a Caesar cipher. It is NOT meant to be cryptographically secure, but to prevent automated detection/analysis from detecting malicious payloads. It calls NO crypto libraries when decrypted (except python does call the library secrets, but that isn't inherently for crypto as opposed to randomness), which is a big plus to avoiding automated detection."

These loaders enable you to load and execute an arbitrary binary in your exploited process. The loaders are coded in a way that it's all done in memory, and they do not require access to system libraries/methods - it's all resolved on the fly. The Macho loader enables you to run bundle files, the ELF loader standard ELF files (no shared objects), and the PE loader enables you to run both DLLs and PE files alike.

					* Abstract—With the rise of attacks using PowerShell in the recent months, there has not been a comprehensive solution for monitoring or prevention. Microsoft recently released the AMSI solution for PowerShell v5, however this can also be bypassed. This paper focuses on repurposing various stealthy runtime .NET hijacking techniques implemented for PowerShell attacks for defensive monitoring of PowerShell. It begins with a brief introduction to .NET and PowerShell, followed by a deeper explanation of various attacker techniques, which is explained from the perspective of the defender, including assembly modification, class and method injection, compiler profiling, and C based function hooking. Of the four attacker techniques that are repurposed for defensive real-time monitoring of PowerShell execution, intermediate language binary modification, JIT hooking, and machine code manipulation provide the best results for stealthy run-time interfaces for PowerShell scripting analysis

					* Quick Retooling in .Net for Red Teams PowerShell gave us a super-highway of convenient building blocks for offensive toolkits and operational automation. However, use of standalone .Net implants may be a desirable option in cases where PowerShell is heavily inspected and logged. While there are great toolkits to invoke unmanaged PowerShell or directly interface with .Net CLR - they are also statically compiled, and therefore easier identified by the defense. Red Teams are faced with specific challenges when they need to retool quickly in the field with .Net payloads. Can .Net toolkits accomplish their goals while maintaining flexibility, quick in-field retooling and operational security in the face of current detection mechanisms? We think so. This talk walks through some of the options present to the operators for .Net code compilation and presents ideas for extensibility of .Net tools at runtime, with the help of Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). We will dive deeper into operational security lessons learned from dynamic code compilation. We will attempt to move beyond static nature of .Net assemblies into reflective DLR, achieving on-the-fly access to native Windows API. We will also discuss some methods of hiding sensitive aspects of execution in managed code memory. We will also touch on ways to help Defense fingerprint the attacks involving dynamic compilation of .Net assemblies, use of DLR and building blocks of offensive tooling involved in the process. A concept tool built on these ideas will be presented and released. It will be used as basis for our discussion.

					* .NET Core is the future of .NET. The Windows-only .NET Framework is on it's way out, and the cross-platform .NET Core is Microsoft's new flagship framework for building software. As red teamers, it's time to go back to the well of .NET as a host for implants and post-exploitation. In this talk, we will analyze the opportunities presented by the new .NET Core platform and practical examples to take advantage of them.
				* [Modern Red Team Weaponization - Mike Felch(WWHF Deadwood 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W-Nlkh6nhg)
					* In an effort to seamlessly equip operators and reduce leaving breadcrumbs, this presentation will walk through methods for modern red team weaponization of offsec tooling. First we will step through the build process which will include automated builds, continuous integration/deployment, and C2 framework integration. Next, we will step through OPSEC considerations for payloads and tooling in an effort to reduce the breadcrumbs being left behind from assemblies. Finally, we will take a look at payload tradecraft for calling managed code (C# tooling) from unmanaged C++ (stub/launchers), low-level syscalls using C#, and code execution leveraging the Windows kernel.

						* One of the best features of the .NET runtime is its in-built ability to call native code, whether that's APIs exposed from dynamic libraries or remote COM objects. Adding this in-built functionality to an "type-safe" runtime has its drawbacks, not the least the introduction of security issues due to misuse. This presentation will go into depth on how the .NET runtime implements its various interop features, where the bodies are buried and how to use that to find issues ranging from novel code execution mechanisms, elevation of privilege up to remote code execution. The presentation will assume the attendee has some familiarity with .NET and how the runtime executes code.

					* PowerShell has been used by the offensive community for several years now. However, recent advances in the defensive security industry are causing offensive toolkits to migrate from PowerShell to reflective C# to evade modern security products. Some of these advancements include Script Block Logging, Antimalware Scripting Interface (AMSI) and the development of signatures for malicious PowerShell activity by third-party security vendors. Several public C# toolkits such as Seatbelt, SharpUp and SharpView have been released to assist with tasks in various phases of the attack lifecycle. One phase of the attack lifecycle that has been missing a C# toolkit is persistence. This talk will be on the public release of a Windows persistence toolkit written in C# called SharPersist.

						* RuralBishop is practically a carbon copy of UrbanBishop by b33f, but all P/Invoke calls have been replaced with D/Invoke. This creates a local RW section in RuralBishop and then maps that section as RX into a remote process. Once the shared section has been established the shellcode is written to the local section which then automatically propagates to the remote process. For execution RuralBishop creates a remote suspended thread (start address is set to ntdll!RtlExitUserThread) and queues an APC on that thread. Once resumed with NtAlertResumeThread, the shellcode executes and the thread exits gracefully on completion.

					* Gscript is a framework for building multi-tenant executors for several implants in a stager. The engine works by embedding runtime logic (powered by the V8 Javascript Virtual Machine) for each persistence technique. This logic gets run at deploy time on the victim machine, in parallel for every implant contained with the stager. The Gscript engine leverages the multi-platform support of Golang to produce final stage one binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Assemblies take the form of executable (.exe) or dynamic link library (.dll) files, and are the building blocks of .NET applications. They provide the common language runtime with the information it needs to be aware of type implementations.

					* With all of the defenses Microsoft has implemented in the PowerShell run-time over the past few years Red Teamers & APT groups have started too shy away from using PowerShell based payloads/delivery mechanisms and migrate over to C#. However, C# is a compiled language, operationally this has a few major downsides: we can?t be as ?flexible? as we could be with scripting languages, setting up a proper development environment has overhead, things need to be compiled etc... in this talk, I will be covering my approach to solving these operational problems by using some of the (possibly?) lesser known features of the .NET framework and introducing BYOI (Bring Your Own Interpreter) payloads which allow you to embed a scripting language of your choosing into any .NET language!

					* .NET malware is well-known by security analysts, but even existing many tools such as dnSpy,.NET Reflector, de4dot and so on to make the analysis easier, most professionals have used them as a black box tool, without concerning to .NET internals, structures, MSIL coding and details. In critical cases, it is necessary have enough knowledge about internal mechanisms and to debug these .NET threats using WinDbg.  Unfortunately, .NET malware samples have become very challenger because it is so complicated to deobfuscated associated resources, as unpacking and dumping them from memory. Furthermore, most GUI debugging tools does an inside view of mechanisms such as CRL Loader, Managed Heap, Synchronization issues and Garbage Collection.  In the other side, .NET malware threats are incredibly interesting when analyzed from the MSIL instruction code, which allows to see code injections using .MSIL and attempts to compromise .NET Runtime keep being a real concern.  The purpose of this presentation is to help professionals to understand .NET malware threats and techniques by explaining concepts about .NET internals, mechanisms and few reversing techniques.

				* [Paper](http://census.gr/media/context-keying-whitepaper.pdf)
				* Exploit payload encoding allows hiding maliciouspayloads from modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Although metamorphic and polymorphic encoding allow such payloads to be hidden from signature-based and anomaly-based IDS,these techniques fall short when the payload is being examined by IDS that can trace the execution of malicious code. Context-keyed encodingis a technique that allows the attacker to encrypt the malicious payload in such a way, that it canonly be executed in an environment (context) withspecific characteristics. By selecting an environment characteristic that will not be present during the IDS trace (but will be present on the target host), the attacker may evade detection by advanced IDS. This paper focuses on the current research in context-keyed payload encoding and proposes a novel encoder that surpasses many of the limitations found in its predecessors.

From the simplest {shell}code to the polymorphism to bypass filters and I{D|P}S (which has lots of new ideas, like application-specific decoders, decoders based on architecture-instructions, and many others), passing through syscall proxying and injection, this talk will explain how it works and how effective they are against the new evolving technologies like network code emulation, with live demonstrations. There is long time since the first paper was released about shellcoding. Most of modern text just tries to explain the assembly structure and many new ideas have just been released as code, never been detailed or explained. The talk will try to fix this gap, also showing some new ideas and considering different architectures.

				* Our payloads are at risk! Incident responders, threat hunters, and automated software solutions are eager to pick apart your new custom dropper and send you back to square one. One answer to this problem is encrypting your payload with key derivation functions ("keying") which leverages a variety of local and remote resources to build the decryption key. Throughout this talk I will present modern keying techniques and demo some tools to help along the way. I will start with showing how easy it is to discover attacker infrastructure or techniques in the payloads we commonly use every day. I will then quickly review how keying helps and the considerations when generating keyed payloads. Throughout the presentation many practical examples of keying techniques will be provided which can be used for typical pentests or full red team operations. Finally I will introduce KeyServer, a new piece to add to your red team infrastructure which handles advanced HTTP and DNS keying. Using unprotected payloads during ops should be a thing of the past. Let’s regain control of our malicious code and make it harder on defenders! This talk is based on the original research of environmental keying by Josh Pitts and Travis Morrow.

			* [Environmental Key Generation towards Clueless Agents - J. Riordan and B. Schneier(1998)](https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1998/06/environmental_key_ge.html)
				* In this paper, we introduce a collection of cryptographic key constructions built from environmental data that are resistant to adversarial analysis and deceit. We expound upon their properties and discuss some possible applications; the primary envisioned use of these constructions is in the creation of mobile agents whose analysis does not reveal their exact purpose.
			* [Strong Cryptography Armoured Computer VirusesForbidding Code Analysis: the bradley virusEric Filiol(2004)](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00070748/document)
				* Imagining what the nature of future viral attacks might look like is the key to successfully protecting against them. This paper discusses how cryptography and key management techniques may definitively checkmate antiviral analysis and mechanisms. We present a generic virus, denoted bradley which protects its code with a very secure, ultra-fast symmetric encryption. Since the main drawback of using encryption in that case lies on the existence of the secret key or information about it within the viral code, we show how to bypass this limitation by using suitable key management techniques. Finally, we show that the complexity of the bradley code analysis is at least as high as that of the cryptanalysis of its underlying encryption algorithm.

				* Imagine there is certain content we want to maintain private until some particular event occurs, when we want to have it automatically disclosed. Suppose, furthermore, that we want this done in a (possibly) malicious host. Say the confidential content is a piece of code belonging to a computer program that should remain ciphered and then “be triggered” (i.e., deciphered and executed) when the underlying system satisfies a preselected condition, which must remain secret after code inspection. In this work we present different solutions for problems of this sort, using different “declassification” criteria, based on a primitive we call secure triggers. We establish the notion of secure triggers in the universally composable security framework of Canetti [2001] and introduce several examples. Our examples demonstrate that a new sort of obfuscation is possible. Finally, we motivate its use with applications in realistic scenarios.

				* To solve the scalability problem introduced by the exponential growth of malware, numerous automated malware analysis techniques have been developed. Unfortunately, all of these approaches make previously unaddressed assumptions that manifest as weaknesses to the tenability of the automated malware analysis process. To highlight this concern, we developed two obfuscation techniques that make the successful execution of a malware sample dependent on the unique properties of the original host it infects. To reinforce the potential for malware authors to leverage this type of analysis resistance, we discuss the Flashback botnet’s use of a similar technique to prevent the automated analysis of its samples.

				* In recent years,the security landscape has witnessed the rise of a new breed of malware, Advanced  Persistence  Threat,  or  APT  for  short.  With  all  traditional  security  solutions failing  to  address  this  new  threat,  a  demand  was  created  for  new  solutions  that  are capable of addressing the advanced capabilities of APT. One of the offeredsolutions was file-based  sandboxes,asolution  that  dynamically  analyzes  files  and  judgestheir  threat levelsbased  on  their  behavior  in  an  emulated/virtual  environment.  But  security  is  a  cat and mouse game, and malware authors are always trying to detect/bypass such measures. Some of the common techniques used by malware for sandbox evasionwill be discussed in  this  paper. This  paperwill  also  analyze  how  to  turn somecountermeasuresused  by sandboxes against it. Finally, itwill introduce some new ideas for sandbox evasion along with recommendationsto address them.

	* [Hillbilly Storytime - Pentest Fails - Adam Compton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSbKeTPv2TU)
		* Whether or not you are just starting in InfoSec, it is always important to remember that mistakes happen, even to the best and most seasoned of analysts. The key is to learn from your mistakes and keep going. So, if you have a few minutes and want to talk a load off for a bit, come and join in as a hillbilly spins a yarn about a group unfortunate pentesters and their misadventures. All stories and events are true (but the names have been be changed to prevent embarrassment).

		* My last 3 years of global reteaming in small and large organisations has shown me that there still are a lot of misconceptions about security. We all know the ‘onion’ model for layered security. While useful for the ‘defence in depth’ principle, this talk will show that in reality, rather than an onion, security is more like a pyramid. The basis is the hardware people work on (laptops etc.) and the top your business applications. In between is everything else. Operating system, network components, proxies, shares, servers and their software stack. Like any hi-rise structure, the top cannot be secure if the base is not secure. Defence in depth matters, but it can be quite trivial for attackers to sidestep certain controls to get to the data they want. Just securing your ‘crown-jewels’ is insufficient. This talk will revolve around how we have defeated security controls on various levels, ranging from the systems your end-users work on, all the way through to 2FA and 4-eye principles on critical business assets. It will talk about common misconceptions which lull companies into a false sense of security, while making life far too easy for attackers. For example the fallacy of focussing security efforts only/mostly on ‘crown jewels’ and how misunderstanding of why certain controls are put in place jeopardize corporate and client data. The talk will be supported by real-life examples

		* Penetration assessments can be a stressful time for those involved. It’s a moment where the network admins find out if the network they manage, or maybe even helped to build, holds up against simulated attacks. Or, it’s a moment as a pen tester where you can help the client and strengthen their security posture, or screw things up by making a mistake - potentially losing a client and giving your company a black eye. However, this shouldn’t be a stressful time. As a client, it is important to understand why the test is taking place and how this helps. As a pentester it is important that you know what you are doing, need to ask for and aren’t just going in blind or throwing the kitchen sink at the network. This talk is to highlight common issues that we’ve either encountered or have have been vented to about from both the penetration tester’s side of the assessment as well as the client’s side. We’d like to bring these issues to light to hopefully help ensure a more smooth assessment “experience” for all parties involved.

			* This talk will be an enjoyable conversation with good beer, great bourbon, and terrific friends who are reliving the journey of infosec maturity from the perspective of both a penetration testing company and their client over a three year period. Details of various engagements will be discussed along with post-mortem analysis, lessons learned, as well as resulting mitigation tactics and defensive strategies. We will discuss the outcomes at each stage of rendered service and how both client and vendor adjusted their approach to re-engage again and again. The engagement culminates in Red Team exercises that clearly demonstrate the infosec evolution of the client. The talk will leave the defensive audience with a sense of hope, a list of achievable goals, and several tactics. The red team with get a glimpse into the maw of the blue future and the value of their tradecraft. Special brief guest appearances and commentary are expected from others in the community that assisted the client along the way as well.
		* [Using blue team techniques in red team ops - Mark Bergman & Marc Smeets(BruCON 0x0A)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjtftdPts4g)
			* When performing multi-month, multi-C2teamserver and multi-scenario red team operations, you are working with an infrastructure that becomes very large quickly. This makes it harder to keep track of what is happening on it. Coupled with the ever-increasing maturity of blue teams, this makes it more likely the blue team is somewhere analysing parts of your infra and/or artefacts. In this presentation we’ll show you how you can use that to your advantage. We’ll present different ways to keep track of the blue team’s analyses and detections, and to dynamically adjust your infra to fool the blue team. We will first set the scene by explaining common and lesser known components of red teaming infrastructures, e.g. dynamic redirectors, domain fronting revisited, decoy websites, html-smuggling, etc. Secondly, we’ll show how to centralize all your infrastructure’s and ops’ information to an ELK stack, leaving it open for intelligent querying across the entire infrastructure and operation. This will also help with better feedback to the blue team at the end of the engagement. Lastly, we’ll dive into novel ways of detecting a blue team’s investigation and we’ll give examples on how to react to these actions, for example by creating honeypots for the blue team.

		* [Looping Surveillance Cameras through Live Editing - Van Albert and Banks - Defcon23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoOqznZUClI)
			* This project consists of the hardware and software necessary to hijack wired network communications. The hardware allows an attacker to splice into live network cabling without ever breaking the physical connection. This allows the traffic on the line to be passively tapped and examined. Once the attacker has gained enough knowledge about the data being sent, the device switches to an active tap topology, where data in both directions can be modified on the fly. Through our custom implementation of the network stack, we can accurately mimic the two devices across almost all OSI layers. We have developed several applications for this technology. Most notable is the editing of live video streams to produce a “camera loop,” that is, hijacking the feed from an Ethernet surveillance camera so that the same footage repeats over and over again. More advanced video transformations can be applied if necessary. This attack can be executed and activated with practically no interruption in service, and when deactivated, is completely transparent.
		* [Sniffing Sunlight - Erik Kamerling - ANYCON2017](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/anycon2017/102-sniffing-sunlight-erik-kamerling)
			* Laser listening devices (laser microphones) are a well understood technology. They have historically been used in the surreptitious surveillance of protected spaces. Using such a device, an attacker bounces an infrared laser off of a reflective surface, and receives the ricocheted beam with a photoreceptor. If the beam is reflected from a surface that is vibrating due to sound (his a typical background target), that sound is subsequently modulated into the beam and can be demodulated at the receptor. This is a known attack method and will be briefly discussed. However, does this principle also hold for non-amplified or naturally concentrated light sources? Can one retrieve modulated audio from reflected sunlight? The idea of modulating voice with sunlight was pioneered by Alexander Graham Bell in 1880 with an invention called the Photophone. A Photophone uses the audio modulation concept now used in laser microphones, but relied on a concentrated beam of sunlight rather than a laser to communicate at distance. Considering that Bell proved that intentionally concentrated sunlight can be used to modulate voice, we will explore under what natural conditions modulated audio can be found in reflected ambient light. Using off the shelf solar-cells and handmade amplifiers, Erik will demonstrate the use of the receiver side of a historic Photophone to identify instances of modulated audio in reflected light under common conditions.

			* Financial institutions, home automation products, and offices near universal cryptographic decoders have increasingly used voice fingerprinting as a method for authentication. Recent advances in machine learning and text-to-speech have shown that synthetic, high-quality audio of subjects can be generated using transcripted speech from the target. Are current techniques for audio generation enough to spoof voice authentication algorithms? We demonstrate, using freely available machine learning models and limited budget, that standard speaker recognition and voice authentication systems are indeed fooled by targeted text-to-speech attacks. We further show a method which reduces data required to perform such an attack, demonstrating that more people are at risk for voice impersonation than previously thought.

			* When my implant gets discovered how will I know? Did the implant stop responding for some benign reason or is the IR team responding? With any luck they'll upload the sample somewhere public so I can find it, but what if I can find out if they start looking for specific bread crumbles in public data sources? At some point without any internal data all blue teams turn to OSINT which puts their searches within view of the advertising industry. In this talk I will detail how I was able to use online advertising to detect when a blue team is hot on my trail.

		* [Modern Red Team Tradecraft - Sajal Thomas(RedTeam VillageDefcon28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f7B-N7yHm8)
			* "Modern attacks against complex network infrastructure highlight a massive gap between state-affiliated cyber espionage attacks and Red Teams. As Red Teams face challenges that real-world attackers do not, replicating the sophisticated threat groups becomes all the more challenging with tight engagement deadlines and report submissions. The talk aims to bridge this gap by providing insights into modern tradecraft employed by the apex predators as well as the coin-miners and ransomware authors. The talk will also discuss the unique relationship between speed and stealth during Red Team operations. Sometimes ""speed is the new stealth"" but with evolved defensive technologies that baseline behaviour of endpoints on the host and network level, slow and steady may be the way to go instead. Additionally, the talk will walk through publicly-known implant design considerations to defeat mature host and network defenses. Bleeding-edge credential harvesting techniques and the evolution of running Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 to digging deep into C/C++ and Win32 API programming will be featured. Lastly, the evolution of a modern Red Team operator/developer/both will be discussed. The skills and mindset required to successfully complete objectives and evade defenses have changed over time. A Red Teamer must evolve to be able to inform defense better."

			* Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) attacks use variousstrategies and techniques to move laterally within an enter-prise environment; however, the existing strategies and tech-niques have limitations such as requiring elevated permissions,creating new connections, performing new authentications, orrequiring process injections. Based on these characteristics,many host and network-based solutions have been proposedto prevent or detect such lateral movement attempts. In thispaper, we present a novel stealthy lateral movement strategy,ShadowMove, in which only established connections betweensystems in an enterprise network are misused for lateral move-ments. It has a set of unique features such as requiring noelevated privilege, no new connection, no extra authentication,and no process injection, which makes it stealthy against state-of-the-art detection mechanisms. ShadowMove is enabled bya novelsocket duplicationapproach that allows a maliciousprocess to silently abuse TCP connections established by be-nign processes. We design and implementShadowMoveforcurrent Windows and Linux operating systems. To validatethe feasibility of ShadowMove, we build several prototypesthat successfully hijack three kinds of enterprise protocols,FTP, Microsoft SQL, and Window Remote Management, toperform lateral movement actions such as copying malware tothe next target machine and launching malware on the targetmachine. We also confirm that our prototypes cannot be de-tected by existing host and network-based solutions, such asfive top-notch anti-virus products (McAfee, Norton, Webroot,Bitdefender, and Windows Defender), four IDSes (Snort, OS-SEC, Osquery, and Wazuh), and two Endpoint Detection andResponse systems (CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent and CiscoAMP).

			* Extreme network's embedded WingOS (Originally created by Motorola) is an operating system used in several wireless devices such as access points and controllers. This OS is being used in Motorola devices, Zebra devices and Extreme network's devices. This research started focusing in an access point widely used in many Aircrafts by several worldwide airlines but ended up in something bigger in terms of devices affected as this embedded operating system is not only used in AP's for Aircrafts but also in Healthcare, Government, Transportation, Smart cities, small to big enterprises... and more. Based on public information, we will see how vulnerable devices are actively used (outdoors) in big cities around the world. But also in Universities, Hotels,Casinos, Big companies, Mines, Hospitals and provides the Wi-Fi access for places such as the New york City Subway. In this presentation we will show with technical details how several critical vulnerabilities were found in this embedded OS. First we will introduce some internals and details about the OS and then we will show the techniques used to reverse engineering the mipsN32 ABI code for the Cavium Octeon processor. It will be discussed how some code was emulated to detect how a dynamic password is generated with a cryptographic algorithm for a root shell backdoor. Besides, it will be shown how some protocols used by some services were reverse engineered to find unauthenticated heap and stack overflow vulnerabilities that could be exploitable trough Wireless or Ethernet connection.

This talk will focus on the next evolution of red teaming and how defeating defenders will take more work and effort. This is a good thing! It's also proof that working together (red and blue) collectively, we can make our security programs more robust in defending against attacks. This talk will dive into actual simulations where defenders have caught us as well as ways that we have circumvented even some of the best detection programs out there today. Let's dive into baselining behavior and refining our tradecraft to evade detection and how we can use that to make blue better.

				* The current model for penetration testing is broken. The typical scan and exploit model doesn?t reflect how real attackers operate after establishing a foothold. At the same time, most organizations aren?t mature enough to need a proper red team assessment. It?s time to start adopting the assumed breach model. In this talk, I?ll discuss techniques for assumed breach assessments that provide a better model for emulating the techniques attackers use once they?re they?ve established a foothold inside a typical network.

				* OPM, Marriot, Equifax - horrible breaches made that much worse due to dwell time. Bad actors spending months or years on an organizations network without anyone noticing a thing. The controls at some of these organizations were in place, defense in depth, layered security, security awareness training - and they still to failed to protect them. The modern wisdom seems to be, despite the fact that you have a responsibility to try your best, the bad guys will always win.

				* Traditional penetration testing often concedes internal access to the tester, but then the tester does a lot of scanning and poking around. This is not representative of most breaches. Most breaches start with a phish and adversary effectively starts with access as one of your users on one of your systems. Are you prepared to defend? In this talk, Tim Medin will discuss the shortcomings of the traditional penetration test, and talk you through ways to deliver (and receive) a higher value penetration test.

			*  In this talk we walk through the entire research engagement, from initial phases such as threat modelling to understand printer attack surfaces to the development of attack methodologies and fuzzing tools used to target printer-specific protocols and functions. Besides of remarking important vulnerabilities found and their respective CVE’s, proof of concept exploits showing how it is possible to gain full control of printers and all of the data they manage will be presented. This will show how to use enterprise printers as a method of persistence on a network, perhaps to exfiltrate sensitive data or support C2 persistence on Red Team engagements. We also address a number of challenges that researchers can face when performing vulnerability research on devices such as printers and how we used different techniques to overcome these challenges, working with limited to no debugging and triage capabilities. We also present mitigations that printer manufacturers can implement in order to reduce printer attack surfaces and render exploitation more difficult.

			* IBM System Z Mainframes are in regular use in Fortune 500 companies. Far from being legacy these systems are running an actively maintained operating system (z/OS). Applications on these often occupy roles critical to the business processes they underpin, with much of the later technology built around them, rather than replacing them. However, these systems are often bypassed by security testing due to worried of availability or assumptions about legacy. This talk will introduce you to assessing mainframe applications, which turn out to be quite similar to web applications. For this purpose we built a tool, Big Iron Recon & Pwnage (BIRP), to assist with performing such assessments. Importantly, our research uncovered a family of mainframe application vulnerabilities introduced by the TN3270 protocol. We found numerous applications, but not all, vulnerable to these flaws. Applications running within the two most popular transaction managers (CICS and IMS) as well as one of IBM’s own applications. The tool released assists with the exploitation of these flaws.

			* This talk will demonstrate how to go from meeting an IBM, zSeries z/OS mainframe, getting root and eventually getting system SPECIAL, using tools that exist currently and newly written scripts. It will also show you how you can get access to a mainframe to help develop your own tools and techniques. This talk will teach you the ‘now what’ after you've encountered a mainframe, returning the balance from the ‘computing mystics’ who run the mainframe back to the community.

			* You thought they were dead didn't you? You thought "I haven't seen a mainframe since the 90s, no one uses those anymore." Well you're wrong. Dead wrong. If you flew or drove to DEF CON your information was hitting a mainframe. Did you use credit or cash at the hotel? Doesn't matter, still a mainframe. Did you pay taxes, or perhaps call 911? What about going to the doctor? All using mainframes. At multiple points throughout the day, even if you don't do anything, your data is going through some mainframe, somewhere. 1984? Yeah right, man. That's a typo. Orwell is here now. He's livin' large. So why is no one talking about them?  SoF & Bigendian Smalls, aka 'the insane chown posse', will dazzle and amaze with feats of hackery never before seen on the mainframe. From fully breaking network job entry (NJE) and their concept of trusted nodes, to showing you what happens when you design security in the 80s and never update your frameworks. We'll demonstrate that, yes Charlie Brown, you can in fact overflow a buffer on the mainframe. New tools will be released! Things like SET'n'3270 (SET, but for mainframes!) and VTAM walker (profiling VTAM applications). Updates to current tools will be released (nmap script galore!) everything from accurate version profiling to application ID brute forcing and beyond. You'll also learn how to navigate IBM so you can get access to your very own mainframe and help continue the research that we've started!  All of your paychecks rely on mainframes in one form or another, so maybe we should be talking about it.

			* In this talk Tyler discusses the highlights from another year of penetration testing. This includes the most direct challenge he has ever received when a CSO told him ‘You wont be able to hack our mainframe’ and the steps he took to gain root access to said mainframe. Tyler will discuss several tools written during the year as well as make public releases of the unpublished tools. Tyler will also discuss the surprising failures he had and what can be learned from those failures. Filled with war stories of social engineering, physical infiltration, internal and external network penetration tests and more this talk will not only be educational but very entertaining.

			* IBM has been touting the security of the mainframe for over 30 years. So much so, that the cult of mainframers believes that the platform is impenetrable. Just try showing how your new attack vector works and you'll be met with 101 reasons why it wouldn't work (until you prove them wrong of course). This talk will take direct aim at the cultist! Previous talks about mainframe security only got you to the front door. Leaving many asking 'great, I got a userid/password, now what?!'. That's what this talk is about: the ‘Now what’. You'll learn a few new techniques to penetrate the mainframe (without a userid/password) and then a bunch of attacks, tricks and mischief you can do to further maintain that access, find important files and really go after the mainframe. During this very Demo Heavy talk you'll learn how to take advantage of APF files, SSL key management, cgi-bin in TYooL 2014, what NJE is and why it's bad, why REXX and SETUID are dangerous and how simple backdoors still work (and will likely go undetected).

			* Have you ever heard about the famous "green screen"? No, it's not a screensaver... Believe me, it still does exist! In many industries, although the front-end systems are all new and shiny, in the back-end they still rely on well-known, proven IBM i (aka AS/400) technology for their back-office, core systems. Surprisingly, nobody truly seems to care about the security. Even if these nice IBM heavy black boxes are directly connected to the Internet... The aim of the talk is to give you more insight in a number of techniques for performing a security test of / securing an IBM i system from perspective of an external and internal intruder. Methods like privilege escalation by nested user switching, getting full system access via JDBC or bypassing the "green screen" (5250) limitations will be presented.

			* The year was 2015 and i just watched a developer submit a job on a test LPAR and run the job in production. I was flabbergasted, how could one submit a job and have it run on another mainframe with out authentication? I was informed it was Network Job Entry and since that moment I made it my mission to completely understand this protocol and how you can use it to break mainframes.  Network Job Entry is how mainframes talk to one another and submit jobs between each other. You can use to manage other mainframes or submit jobs and transfer files. But what if we can pretend to be a mainframe with python? This talk will go in to a deep dive about the protocol, vulnerabilities within it, how you can use it to attack your own mainframes and how IBM is a bunch of tricky tricksters who change protocols silently so your nmap script stop working (true story). This talk will cover JES2, JCL, SNA, Network Job Entry, vulnerabilities, and how you can secure your setup. A python library will be discussed and multiple new tools using that library will be released.

			* Virtual Appliances have become very prevalent these days as virtualization is ubiquitous and hypervisors commonplace. More and more of the major vendors are providing literally virtual clones for many of their once physical-only products. Like IoT and the CAN bus, it's early in the game and vendors are late as usual. One thing that it catching these vendors off guard is the huge additional attack surface, ripe with vulnerabilities, added in the process. Also, many vendors see software appliances as an opportunity for the customer to easily evaluate the product before buying the physical one, making these editions more accessible and debuggable by utilizing features of the platform on which it runs. During this talk, I will provide real case studies for various vulnerabilities created by mistakes that many of the major players made when shipping their appliances. You'll learn how to find these bugs yourself and how the vendors went about fixing them, if at all. By the end of this talk, you should have a firm grasp of how one goes about getting remotes on these appliances.

		* Direct from the mind of the guy who bought you the "I will kill you" presentation at DEF CON 23, is another mind bending, entertaining talk. This time it’s bigger and badder than before. Are you sick and tired of your government? Can’t wait another 4 years for an election? Or do you want to be like the CIA and overthrow a government overseas for profit or fun? If you answered yes to one or more of these questions than this talk is for you! Why not create your own cyber mercenary unit and invoke a regime change to get the government you want installed? After all, if you want the job done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. Find out how over the last 60 years, governments and resource companies have been directly involved in architecting regime changes around world using clandestine mercenaries to ensure deniability. This has been achieved by destabilizing the ruling government, providing military equipment, assassinations, financing, training rebel groups and using government agencies like the CIA, Mossad and MI-5 or using foreign private mercenaries such as Executive Order and Sandline. Working with Simon Mann an elite ex SAS soldier turned coup architect who overthrew governments in Africa, Chris Rock will show you how mercenary coup tactics directly applied to digital mercenaries to cause regime changes as the next generation of "Cyber Dogs of War".

	* [Infecting The Embedded Supply Chain - Zach Miller, Alex Kissinger(Defcon26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiET4FuGjE)
		* With a surge in the production of internet of things (IoT) devices, embedded development tools are becoming commonplace and the software they run on is often trusted to run in escalated modes. However, some of the embedded development tools on the market contain serious vulnerabilities that put users at risk. In this talk we discuss the various attack vectors that these embedded development tools expose users to, and why users should not blindly trust their tools. This talk will detail a variety reverse engineering, fuzzing, exploit development and protocol analysis techniques that we used to analyze and exploit the security of a common embedded debugger.

	* [Playing Through the Pain? - The Impact of Secrets and Dark Knowledge - Richard Thieme(Defcon24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGrcHhfUZDk)
		* Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact when those secrets build a different map of reality than "normals" use and one has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. The cognitive dissonance that inevitably causes is managed by some with denial who live as if refusing to feel the pain makes it disappear. But as Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, refuses to go away. And when cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one's peril. But the constraints of one's work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one's clearances, work, and career. The real cost of security work and professional intelligence goes beyond dollars. It is measured in family life, relationships, and mental and physical well-being.   The divorce rate is as high among intelligence professionals as it is among medical professionals, for good reason - how can relationships be based on openness and trust when one's primary commitments make truth-telling and disclosure impossible?
	* [The Impact of Dark Knowledge and Secrets on Security and Intelligence Professionals - Richard Thieme(NSEC2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MzcPBAj88A&list=PLuUtcRxSUZUpv2An-RNhjuZSJ5fjY7ghe)
		* Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact on life, work, and relationships of building a different map of reality than “normal people” use. One has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. One has to live defensively, warily. This causes at the least cognitive dissonance which some manage by denial. But refusing to feel the pain does not make it go away. It just intensifies the consequences when they erupt. Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, does not go away. When cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one’s peril. But the very constraints of one’s work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one’s clearances, work, and career. And whistle blower protection is often non-existent.
