	* **Things to Know**
		* [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
			* "The primary aim of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project is to normalize the range in the coverage and level of rigor available in the market when it comes to performing Web application security verification using a commercially-workable open standard. The standard provides a basis for testing application technical security controls, as well as any technical security controls in the environment, that are relied on to protect against vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. This standard can be used to establish a level of confidence in the security of Web applications."
		* [OWASP Top Ten Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project)
			* The OWASP Top 10 is a powerful awareness document for web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list.
		* [The Website Obesity Crisis](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm)
		* [XSS, CSRF, CSP, JWT, WTF? IDK `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` - Dominik Kundel(JSConf Iceland2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mqdsfWdmE)
			* `Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--` The little Bobby Tables is embodying the classical fear of SQL injections when building web applications. However, SQL injections are just one aspect of things we need to worry about when building web applications. With the recent popularity of Angular, React and other Single Page Application frameworks we got more logic executing on the front-end create new problems and make you forget about others. In this talk you will learn about XSS, CSRF, CORS, JWT, HTTPS, SPAs, REST APIs and other weird abbreviations, how to protect yourself and your users from the new generation of Bobby Tables.

* **Browsers**
	* [Browser-2020](https://github.com/luruke/browser-2020)
		* Things you can do with a browser in 2020
		* It's like, did no one read 'The Tangled Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications'? Or did they, and their take away was, 'Man, what a bunch of great ideas! Blinking text with no user control? Woah. I'm so on this.'. 
		* My point is that it is 2020, and there is no equivalent to NoScript or UBlock Origin in any major browser. Despite this, I can have picture in picture video chats, while also connecting by bluetooth and USB, devices to the browser and having each tab color coded, along with the browser knowing my power level of my device, all according to standards.
		* It's 2020, still no equivalent of NoScript or UBlock Origin available by default in any of the major browsers. 
			* Yet, I can share files with others, using a contextual menu depending on installed applications, or I can give my browser access to my insecure USB and Bluetooth devices, while it makes sure my battery isn't dead from the power consumption while the containing tabs for each webapp are properly color coded. 🤔
		* Google released a paper the day after I made this comment. I stand by my comment.
		* [Oh, the Places You’ll Go! Finding Our Way Back from the Web Platform’sIll-conceived Jaunts - Artur Janc, Mike West(2020)](https://secweb.work/papers/janc2020places.pdf)
			* In this paper, we start from a scattered list of concretegrievances about the web platform based on informal dis-cussions among browser– and web security engineers. Afterreviewing the details of these issues, we work towards amodel of the root causes of the problems, categorizing thembased on the type of risk they introduce to the platform.We then identify possible solutions for each class of issues,dividing them by the most effective approach to address it.In the end, we arrive at a general blueprint for backingout of these dead ends. We propose a three-pronged approachwhich includes changing web browser defaults, creating aslew of features for web authors to opt out of dangerousbehaviors, and adding new security primitives. We then showhow this approach can be practically applied to addresseach of the individual problems, providing a conceptualframework for solving unsafe legacy web platform behaviors.

The image can then be uploaded onto a trusted website like Twitter or Google (usually whitelisted by CSP) and then loaded as a remote image in a HTML document. Finally, by using the canvas getImageData method, it's possible to extract the "hidden JavaScript" from the image and execute it. Sometimes this could lead to a Content-Security-Policy bypass making an attacker able to include an entire and external JavaScript library."

Specifications that enable an API to make cross-origin requests to resources can use the algorithms defined by this specification. If such an API is used on `http://example.org` resources, a resource on `http://hello-world.example` can opt in using the mechanism described by this specification (e.g., specifying `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.org` as response header), which would allow that resource to be fetched cross-origin from `http://example.org`.

I will also talk about recent security bugs (CVE-2018-18511, CVE-2019-5814 and CVE-2019-9797) I discovered in the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and Opera which allows stealing sensitive images via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)."

		* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism for relaxing the Same Origin Policy to enable communication between websites via browsers. It's already widely understood that certain CORS configurations are dangerous. In this presentation, I'll skim over the old knowledge then coax out and share with you an array of under-appreciated but dangerous subtleties and implications buried in the CORS specification. I'll illustrate each of these with recent attacks on real websites, showing how I could have used them to steal bitcoins from two different exchanges, partially bypass Google's use of HTTPS, and requisition API keys from numerous others. I'll also show how CORS blunders can provide an invaluable link in crafting exploit chains to pivot across protocols, exploit the unexploitable via server and client-side cache poisoning, and even escalate certain open redirects into vulnerabilities that are actually notable.

		* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a complex and commonly misunderstood concept that is often implemented wrong for the right reasons. In this talk we will explain the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) and CORS in an easy to understand way. We will then discuss poor implementations of CORS and the resulting issues. We'll continue by releasing research done on a number of development frameworks exposing poorly designed CORS libraries that default to the most dangerous behavior. We'll then demonstrate why all of this matters by conducting a distributed attack against the most common CORS configuration using audience participation and a new tool. Finally, we'll discuss the safest ways to implement CORS. The custom tools used during the talk will be released along with the presentation.

		* Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is extremely common on modern web apps, but scanning tools are terrible at analyzing CORS policy. If testers really understand CORS policy, a damaging exploit is often not far away. Is it possible to force a user to do something significant? Does using a GUID offer any protection? Does the authentication mechanism really protect against cross-origin attacks? Is it really risky to allow all origins? Do pre-flight requests always help? CORS requests get tricky very quickly and scanning tools do not have a good understanding of the intricacies that surface during actual application testing. A quick and dirty JavaScript exploit will put the issue to rest and eliminate hours of theoretical debate. This presentation covers how CORS works and how to find misconfigurations. Dozens of actual applications are distilled into examples demonstrate CORS protections and JavaScript code to bypass them. A basic knowledge of CORS and JavaScript will be helpful to understand the exploit code, but no special background is necessary to grasp the basics of CORS configuration.

		* This document outlines Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB), an algorithm by which dubious cross-origin resource loads may be identified and blocked by web browsers before they reach the web page. CORB reduces the risk of leaking sensitive data by keeping it further from cross-origin web pages. In most browsers, it keeps such data out of untrusted script execution contexts. In browsers with Site Isolation, it can keep such data out of untrusted renderer processes entirely, helping even against side channel attacks.

Actually it was a vulnerable cookie found on several domains owned by Epic Games that allowed me to hijack traffic of users of their websites, steal session tokens and of course, BeEF hook em'. I will describe my journey from creating a custom cookie fuzzing tool (Anomalous Cookie) to help identify vulnerable cookies, to creating a framework for 'Cookie Baking'. Cookie Baking is the technique of creating or modifying a cookie in a users' local Cookie Jar (this includes stuffing with malicious payloads, affiliate tags, fuzz-strings and more). I will also provide insight into the Bug Bounty process, how Google responded to my request for them to protect local cookies at rest, and how I created WHID-Injected Cookies! ;)

		* 18 years have passed since Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) became the single most common security problem in web applications. Since then, numerous efforts have been proposed to detect, fix or mitigate it, but these piecemeal efforts have not combined to make it easy to produce XSS-free code. This talk explains how Google's security team has achieved a high-level of safety against XSS and related problems by integrating tools to make it easier for developers to produce secure software than vulnerable, and to bound the portion of a codebase that could contribute to a vulnerability. We will show how this works in practice and end with advice on how to achieve the same results on widely-used, open-source stacks and new browser mechanisms that will make it much easier to achieve high-levels of security with good developer experience.

			* The meteoric rise of SPDY, HTTP/2, and QUIC has gone largely unremarked upon by most of the security field. QUIC is an application-layer UDP-based protocol that multiplexes connections between endpoints at the application level, rather than the kernel level. HTTP/2 (H2) is a successor to SPDY, and multiplexes different HTTP streams within a single connection. More than 10% of the top 1 Million websites are already using some of these technologies, including much of the 10 highest traffic sites. Whether you multiplex out across connections with QUIC, or multiplex into fewer connections with HTTP/2, the world has changed. We have a strong sensation of Déjà vu with this work and our 2014 Black Hat USA MPTCP research. We find ourselves discussing a similar situation in new protocols with technology stacks evolving faster than ever before, and Network Security is largely unaware of the peril already upon it. This talk briefly introduces QUIC and HTTP/2, covers multiplexing attacks beyond MPTCP, discusses how you can use these techniques over QUIC and within HTTP/2, and discusses how to make sense of and defend against H2/QUIC traffic on your network. We will also demonstrate, and release, some tools with these techniques incorporated.
* **HTTP Parameter Pollution**
	* **101**
		* [HTTP Parameter Pollution - Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/http-parameter-pollution/)
			* HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is a Web attack evasion technique that allows an attacker to craft a HTTP request in order to manipulate or retrieve hidden information. This evasion technique is based on splitting an attack vector between multiple instances of a parameter with the same name. Since none of the relevant HTTP RFCs define the semantics of HTTP parameter manipulation, each web application delivery platform may deal with it differently. In particular, some environments process such requests by concatenating the values taken from all instances of a parameter name within the request. This behavior is abused by the attacker in order to bypass pattern-based security mechanisms.

	* [OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol - rfc7591](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591)
		* This specification defines mechanisms for dynamically registering OAuth 2.0 clients with authorization servers. Registration requests send a set of desired client metadata values to the authorization server. The resulting registration responses return a client identifier to use at the authorization server and the client metadata values registered for the client. The client can then use this registration information to communicate with the authorization server using the OAuth 2.0 protocol. This specification also defines a set of common client metadata fields and values for clients to use during registration.
	* [The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: JWT Secured Authorization Request - ietf.org](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq-15)
		* The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes query parameter serialization, which means that Authorization Request parameters are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web browsers. While it is easy to implement, it means that (a) the communication through the user agents are not integrity protected and thus the parameters can be tainted, and (b) the source of the communication is not authenticated. Because of these weaknesses, several attacks to the protocol have now been put forward. This document introduces the ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which allows the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication and confidentiality property of the Authorization Request is attained. The request can be sent by value or by reference.

		* What if you roll out OAuth, and realize there are a bunch of small things you didn’t consider? It’s what happened to us at Pipedrive, and although it’s likely not over just yet, we’re running smoothly. It’s a good time to share what we’ve learned and save others some time. While building Pipedrive’s marketplace for third-party apps, we transitioned from API token authentication to OAuth, and it’s been an interesting learning experience. In this talk, I will explain how the protocol works, discuss differences in how OAuth is implemented on different platforms, and explain how we managed the transition from API token to OAuth. I will explain how CSRF attacks work in OAuth, how the state parameter can prevent them, how to manage synchronization between server and clients, and what you can run into when you roll out OAuth for dozens of apps.

		* In this paper, we demonstrate the powerful capabilitiesthat modern browser APIs provide to attackers by presentingMarioNet: a framework that allows a remote malicious entity tocontrol a visitor’s browser and abuse its resources for unwantedcomputation or harmful operations, such as cryptocurrencymining, password-cracking, and DDoS. MarioNet relies solely onalready available HTML5 APIs, without requiring the installationof any additional software. In contrast to previous browser-based botnets, the persistence and stealthiness characteristics ofMarioNet allow the malicious computations to continue in thebackground of the browser even after the user closes the windowor tab of the initially visited malicious website. We present thedesign, implementation, and evaluation of our prototype system,which is compatible with all major browsers, and discuss potentialdefense strategies to counter the threat of such persistent in-browser attacks. Our main goal is to raise awareness about thisnew class of attacks, and inform the design of future browserAPIs so that they provide a more secure client-side environmentfor web applications.

	* [SSL/TLS Interception Proxies and Transitive Trust](http://media.blackhat.com/bh-eu-12/Jarmoc/bh-eu-12-Jarmoc-SSL_TLS_Interception-WP.pdf)
		* Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor Transport Layer Security (TLS), have become key components of the modern Internet. The privacy, integrity, and authenticity provided by these protocols are critical to allowing sensitive communications to occur. Without these systems, e-commerce, online banking, and business-to-business exchange of information would likely be far less frequent. Threat actors have also recognized the benefits of transport security, and they are increasingly turning to SSL to hide their activities. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT ) attackers, botnets, and eve n commodity web attacks can leverage SSL encryption to evade detection. To counter these tactics, organizations are increasingly deploying security controls that intercept end-to-end encrypted channels. Web proxies, data loss prevention (DLP) systems, specialized threat detection solutions, and network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) offer functionality to intercept, inspect, and filter encrypted traffic. Similar functionality is present in lawful intercept systems and solutions enabling the broad surveillance of encrypted communications by governments. Broadly classified as “SSL/TLS interception proxies”, these solutions act as a “man-in-the-middle", violating the end-to-end security promises of SSL. This type of interception comes at a cost. Intercepting SSL-encrypted connections sacrifices a degree of privacy and integrity for the benefit of content inspection, often at the risk of authenticity and endpoint validation. Implementers and designers of SSL interception proxies should consider these risks and understand how their systems operate in unusual circumstances

This technique allows normally separate elements such as images and style sheets to be fetched in a single Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request, which may be more efficient than multiple HTTP requests, and used by several browser extensions to package images as well as other multimedia contents in a single HTML file for page saving. As of 2015, data URIs are fully supported by most major browsers, and partially supported in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

Each endpoint is injected with cleverly generated values within the boundaries defined by the specification, and outside of it, the appropriate requests are sent and their success or failure are reported in a detailed manner. You may also extend it to run various security attack vectors, such as illegal resource access, XSS, SQLi and RFI, that are targeted at the existing endpoints, or even at non-existing ones. No human intervention is needed. Simply run the tool and get the results."

		* Abstract: Since the early days of Netscape, browser vendors and web security researchers have restricted out-going data based on its destination. The security argument accompanying these mechanisms is that they prevent sensitive user data from being sent to the attacker’s domain. However, in this paper, we show that regulating web information flow based on its destination server is an inherently flawed security practice. It is vulnerable to self-exfiltration attacks, where an adversary stashes stolen information in the database of a whitelisted site, then later independently connects to the whitelisted site to retrieve the information. We describe eight existing browser security mechanisms that are vulnerable to these “self-exfiltration” attacks. Furthermore, we discovered at least one exfiltration channel for each of the Alexa top 100 websites. None of the existing information flow control mechanisms we surveyed are sufficient to protect data from being leaked to the attacker. Our goal is to prevent browser vendors and researchers from falling into this trap by designing more systems that are vulnerable to self-exfiltration.

What if high-traffic websites served obfuscated code that secretly borrowed clock cycles from their client’s web browser as a means of distributed computing? In this talk I present research on the topic of using web browsers as zero-configuration, trojan-less botnets. The presentation includes a brief history of botnets, followed by an overview of techniques to build and deploy command-and-control botnet clients that run in-browser.

			* For the past few years, malware authors have abused the extension development functionality of Chrome and Firefox. More often than not, these extensions are abused for standard crimeware activities, such as ad click fraud, cryptocurrency mining, or stealing banking credentials. But this is only scratching the surface of what is possible if the appropriate browser APIs are abused. Extensions can act as a foothold into a target's internal network, provided a single user can be convinced to click two buttons. As a post-exploitation mechanism, extensions can be side-loaded with the ability to read and write files to disk. These actions will all be performed from the browser process(es) and likely go undetected by conventional endpoint protection solutions. This talk will discuss the creation, deployment, and usage of malicious browser extensions so that other red teamers can add this attack vector to their toolkit.

We have employed this methodology at Facebook for six weeks, identifying more than 1700 lexically distinct malicious extensions. We use this labelling to drive user device clean-up efforts as well to report to antimalware and browser vendors.

	* [BeEF Browser Exploitation Framework](http://beefproject.com/)
	* [BeEF](https://github.com/beefproject/beef)
		* Amid growing concerns about web-borne attacks against clients, including mobile clients, BeEF allows the professional penetration tester to assess the actual security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened network perimeter and client system, and examines exploitability within the context of the one open door: the web browser. BeEF will hook one or more web browsers and use them as beachheads for launching directed command modules and further attacks against the system from within the browser context.
	* [Browsers Gone Wild - Angelo Prado & Xiaoran Wang - BHAsia2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsjCQlEsgW8)
		* In this talk, we will demonstrate and unveil the latest developments on browser specific weaknesses including creative new mechanisms to compromise confidentiality, successfully perform login and history detection, serve mixed content, deliver malicious ghost binaries without a C&C server, exploit cache/timing side channels to extract secrets from third-party domains, and leverage new HTML5 features to carry out more stealthy attacks. This is a practical presentation with live demos that will challenge your knowledge of the Same Origin Policy and push the limits of what is possible with today's web clients.

		* As a part of an ongoing investigation on Adobe Flash SOP bypass techniques, we identified a vulnerability affecting old releases of the Adobe Flex SDK compiler. Further investigation traced the issue back to a well known vulnerability (CVE20112461), already patched by Adobe. Old vulnerability, let's move on? Not this time. CVE20112461 is a very interesting bug. As long as the SWF file was compiled with a vulnerable Flex SDK, attackers can still use this vulnerability against the latest web browsers and Flash plugin. Even with the most recent updates, vulnerable Flex applications hosted on your domain can be exploited. In this presentation, we will disclose the details of this vulnerability (Adobe has never released all technicalities) and we will discuss how we conducted a large scale analysis on popular websites, resulting in the identification of numerous Alexa Top 50 sites vulnerable to this bug. Finally, we will also release a custom tool and a Burp plugin capable of detecting vulnerable SWF applications.

The use of this technology has achieved rapid adoption and is now leveraged by companies such as GitHub, Credit Karma, and PayPal. Companies such as Hacker One and New Relic have suffered from critical vulnerabilities hidden within GraphQL endpoints. In this talk we will learn enough about GraphQL to be dangerous. Demonstrate how to use the technology?s intricacies against itself while taking advantage of implementation errors and misconfigurations. Examine GraphQL specific attacks as well as tried and true techniques adapted to fit into the GraphQL context. Then walk through how to carry out these attacks efficiently and effectively, introducing a tool to help automate and streamline the process.

		* I like webapps, don't you? Webapps have got to be the best way to learn about security. Why? Because they're self-contained and so very transparent. You don't need a big ol' lab before you can play with them. You can run them in a single tiny VM or even tiny-er Docker image on your laptop. And so long as you're attacking your own stuff, it's easy to stay out of trouble. You're up and running in the time it takes for a single download.  And the transparent part? Ever since "view source" in the earliest web browsers, it's been easy to see exactly what's going on in a webapp and in the browser. Every webapp you ever use has no choice but to give you the (client-side) source code! It's almost like there's no such thing as a "black box" webapp pentest, if you think about it... Anyhow - the Developer Tools in Firefox (and Chrome) are what happens when you take "view source" and add 25 years or so of creativity and power.  We'll look at the Developer Tools in the latest Firefox with a pentester's eye. Inspect and change the DOM (Document Object Model), take screenshots, find and extract key bits of data, use the console to run Javascript in the site's origin context and even pause script execution in the debugger if things go too fast... Maybe we'll convince you that you can realistically do a big chunk of a webapp pentest without ever leaving the browser.

			* JSON Web tokens (JWTs) are used massively in API-based applications as access tokens or to transport information across services. Unfortunately, JWT are often mis-used and incorrectly handled. Massive data breaches have occurred in the last 18 months due to token leakage and lack of proper of validation. This session focuses on best practices and real world examples of JWT usage, where we cover: Typical scenarios where using JWT is a good idea; Typical scenarios where using JWT is a bad idea!; Principles of Zero trust architecture and why you should always validate; Best practices to thoroughly validate JWTs and potential vulnerabilities if you don’t.; Use cases when encryption may be required for JWT

			* Nowadays, JSON Web Tokens are everywhere. They are used as session tokens or just to pass data between applications or µservices. By design, JWT contains a high number of security and cryptography pitfalls. In this talk, we are going to learn how to exploit (with demos) some of those issues. After covering the basics (None and Algorithm confusion), we are going to move to kid injection, embedded JWK (CVE-2018-0114). Finally, we will look at jku and x5u attributes and how they can be abused by chaining vulnerabilities.

		* [The Hacker's Guide to JWT Security by Patrycja Wegrzynowicz(2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wXQW-dIyL8)
			* JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard for creating tokens that assert some number of claims like a logged in user and his/her roles. JWT is widely used in modern applications as a stateless authentication mechanism. Therefore, it is important to understand JWT security risks, especially when broken authentication is among the most prominent security vulnerabilities according to the OWASP Top 10 list.  This talk guides you through various security risks of JWT, including confidentiality problems, vulnerabilities in algorithms and libraries, token cracking, token sidejacking, and more. In live demos, you’ll learn how to hijack a user account exploiting common security vulnerabilities on the client-side, on the server-side, and in transport.  You’ll also find out about common mistakes and vulnerabilities along with the best practices related to the implementation of JWT authentication and the usage of available JWT libraries.

		* Getting application security right often requires that developers have a deeper than average understanding of the security domain. In what other industry is this the case? We don't have to be M.D.s to get a medical diagnosis; we don't have to be auto mechanics to get our cars fixed, yet we in security wag our fingers at "iD10t errors" and build grand mousetraps to catch "so obvious" developer missteps, when they may not know what they need to add, change or remove from their applications to make it "secure" in the first place. Furthermore, patterns to address these issues don't always fit the requirements of the application short or long term, resulting in solutions that only address part of the problem, or worse, are omitted altogether because they are too cumbersome to implement. My answer to this is _spartan-a node application created for developers of node.js applications, not security people. _spartan allows developers to create security policies which address their node app's (whether it be Desktop, Web, Mobile, IoT or API) specific requirements; it installs & configures the modules to match the policy and; it generates the boilerplate code that developers can import directly into their applications.

		* [BlackHat Slides](https://i.blackhat.com/USA-20/Wednesday/us-20-Xiao-Discovering-Hidden-Properties-To-Attack-Nodejs-Ecosystem.pdf)
		* Node.js is widely used for developing both server-side and desktop applications. It provides a cross-platform execution environment for JavaScript programs. Due to the increasing popularity, the security of Node.js is critical to web servers and desktop clients. We present a novel attack method against the Node.js platform, called hidden property abusing (HPA). The new attack leverages the widely-used data exchanging feature of JavaScript to tamper critical program states of Node.js programs, like server-side applications. HPA entitles remote attackers to launch serious attacks, such as stealing confidential data, bypassing security checks, and launching denial of service attacks. To help developers detect the HPA issues of their Node.js applications, we develop a tool, named LYNX, that utilizes hybrid program analysis to automatically reveal HPA vulnerabilities and even synthesize exploits. We apply LYNX on a set of widely-used Node.js programs and identify 13 previously unknown vulnerabilities. LYNX successfully generates 10 severe exploits. We have reported all of our findings to the Node.js community. At the time of paper writing, we have received the confirmation of 12 vulnerabilities and got 12 CVEs assigned. Moreover, we collaborated with an authoritative public vulnerability database to help them use a new vulnerability notion and description in related security issues. The talk consists of four parts. First, we will introduce recent offensive research on Node.js. Second, we will introduce HPA by demonstrating an exploit on a widely-used web framework. Third, we will explain how to leverage program analysis techniques to automatically detect and exploit HPA. In the end, we will have a comprehensive evaluation which discusses how we identified 13 HPA 0days with the help of our detection method.

			* We provide a number of practical techniques and algorithms for exploiting randomness vulnerabilities in PHP applications.We focus on the predictability of password reset tokens and demonstrate how an attacker can take over user accounts in a web application via predicting or algorithmically derandomizing the PHP core randomness generators. While our techniques are designed for the PHP language, the principles behind our techniques and our algorithms are independent of PHP and can readily apply to any system that utilizes weak randomness generators or low entropy sources. Our results include: algorithms that reduce the entropy of time variables, identifying and exploiting vulnera- bilities of the PHP system that enable the recovery or reconstruction of PRNG seeds, an experimental analysis of the Hastad-Shamir framework for breaking truncated linear variables, an optimized online Gaussian solver for large sparse linear systems, and an algorithm for recovering the state of the Mersenne twister generator from any level of truncation.  We demonstrate the gravity of our attacks via a number of case studies. Specifically, we show that a number of current widely used web applications can be broken using our tech- niques including Mediawiki, Joomla, Gallery, osCommerce and others.

However, the language has gone through extensive changes and none of previous exploitation techniques are relevant. In this talk, we explore the new memory internals of the language from exploiters and vulnerability researchers point of view. We will explain newly found vulnerabilities in the 'unserialize' mechanism of the language and present re-usable primitives for remote exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

We analyze how PHP object injection (POI) vulnerabilities can be exploited via property-oriented programming (POP) and perform a systematic analysis of available gadgets in common PHP applications. Furthermore, we introduce an automated approach to statically detect POI vulnerabilities in object-oriented PHP code. Our approach is also capable of generating POP chains in an automated way. We implemented a prototype of the proposed approach and evaluated it with 10 well-known applications. Overall, we detected 30 new POI vulnerabilities and 28 new gadget chains

		* REST, or Representational State Transfer, just refers to the protocol with which the whole Web works. No big. We are used to using REST with a browser, but there is more to it - we can write programs with REST. The problem is that writing properties and functions using the web's transfer protocol open them up to all of the security weaknesses of the web, and we know there are a few of those. Finding those bugs is just half of the battle - fixing them is a whole other story. You'll need the details, and you'll get them here.

		* WebAssembly is a new technology that allows web developers to run native C/C++on a webpage with near-native performance. This paper provides a basic introduc-tiontoWebAssemblyandexaminesthesecurityrisksthatadevelopermaytakeonbyusing it. We cover several examples exploring the theoretical security implications ofWebAssembly. We also cover Emscripten, which is currently the most popular Web-Assembly compiler toolchain. Our assessment of Emscripten includes its implemen-tation of compiler-and-linker-level exploit mitigations as well as the internal harden-ing of itslibcimplementation, and how its augmentation of WASM introduces newattack vectors and methods of exploitation. We also provide examples of memorycorruption exploits in the Wasm environment. Under certain circumstances, theseexploits could lead to to hijacking control flow or even executing arbitrary JavaScriptwithin the context of the web page. Finally, we provide a basic outline of best prac-tices and security considerations for developers wishing to integrate WebAssemblyinto their product.
	* [Everything Old is New Again:Binary Security of WebAssembly - Daniel Lehmann, Johannes Kinder, Michael Pradel(2020)](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-lehmann.pdf)
		* WebAssembly is an increasingly popular compilation targetdesigned to run code in browsers and on other platforms safelyand securely, by strictly separating code and data, enforcingtypes, and limiting indirect control flow. Still, vulnerabilitiesin memory-unsafe source languages can translate to vulnera-bilities in WebAssembly binaries. In this paper, we analyze towhat extent vulnerabilities are exploitable in WebAssemblybinaries, and how this compares to native code. We find thatmany classic vulnerabilities which, due to common mitiga-tions, are no longer exploitable in native binaries, are com-pletely exposed in WebAssembly. Moreover, WebAssemblyenables unique attacks, such as overwriting supposedly con-stant data or manipulating the heap using a stack overflow. Wepresent a set of attack primitives that enable an attacker (i) towrite arbitrary memory, (ii) to overwrite sensitive data, and(iii) to trigger unexpected behavior by diverting control flowor manipulating the host environment. We provide a set ofvulnerable proof-of-concept applications along with completeend-to-end exploits, which cover three WebAssembly plat-forms. An empirical risk assessment on real-world binariesand SPEC CPU programs compiled to WebAssembly showsthat our attack primitives are likely to be feasible in practice.Overall, our findings show a perhaps surprising lack of binarysecurity in WebAssembly. We discuss potential protectionmechanisms to mitigate the resulting risks.

		* This talk illustrates a number of techniques to smuggle and reshape HTTP requests using features such as HTTP Pipelining that are not normally used by testers. The strange behaviour of web servers with different technologies will be reviewed using HTTP versions 1.1, 1.0, and 0.9 before HTTP v2 becomes too popular! Some of these techniques might come in handy when dealing with a dumb WAF or load balancer that blocks your attacks.

		* All modern Web Application Firewalls are able to intercept (and even block) most common attacks from the web. However, what happens when an attacker uses HTTP2 to send attack traffic to a web application or service? In this talk we will cover basic attacks against web applications using HTTP2 to bypass WAFs and Proxies. Attendees will gain knowledge of how to bypass WAF and Proxies using the HTTP2 Protocol, and steps they can take to protect themselves against these kinds of attacks.

	* [Paper Testing stateful web application workflows - SANS - András Veres-Szentkirályi](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/testing/testing-stateful-web-application-workflows-36637)
		* Most web applications used for complex business operations and/or employing advanced GUI frameworks have stateful functionality. Certain workflows, for example, might require completing certain steps before a transaction is committed, or a request sent by a client-side UI element might need several preceding requests that all contribute to the session state. Most automated tools focus on a request and maybe a redirection, thus completely missing the point in these cases, where resending a request gets ignored by the target application. As a result, while these tools are getting better day by day, using them for testing such execution paths are usually out of the question. Since thorough assessment is cumbersome without such tools, there's progress, but we are far from plug-and-play products. This paper focuses on the capabilities of currently available solutions, demonstrating their pros and cons, along with opportunities for improvement.

In this document, I'll share the conception and development of an alternative approach, capable of finding and confirming both known and unknown classes of injection vulnerabilities. Evolved from classic manual techniques, this approach reaps many of the benefits of manual testing including casual WAF evasion, a tiny network footprint, and flexibility in the face of input filtering.

				* The domain name is one of the most prominent assets an organization can have. While customers can discover an organization from many sources - social media, review aggregators, advertisements, etc - the webpage is often the first direct experience a person has with a business and brand. This vital role makes the domain a target for fraud, data leakage, and cyber attack. Implementing domain monitoring and performing risk assessments is important, but only half the battle. In this talk, we will consider amount of intelligence one can gather starting from only a domain name and investigate how this sets an attacker up with an ideal blueprint for malicious action. 
		* **Tools**
			* [AttackSurfaceMapper](https://github.com/superhedgy/AttackSurfaceMapper)
				* Attack Surface Mapper is a reconnaissance tool that uses a mixture of open source intellgence and active techniques to expand the attack surface of your target.

It does so by using [jsbeautifier](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify) for python in combination with a fairly large regular expression.
			* [relative-url-extractor](https://github.com/jobertabma/relative-url-extractor)
				* During reconnaissance (recon) it is often helpful to get a quick overview of all the relative endpoints in a file. These days web applications have frontend pipelines that make it harder for humans to understand minified code. This tool contains a nifty regular expression to find and extract the relative URLs in such files. This can help surface new targets for security researchers to look at. It can also be used to periodically compare the results of the same file, to see which new endpoints have been deployed. History has shown that this is a goldmine for bug bounty hunters.

		* This paper describes how some HTML browsers can be tricked through the use of HTML forms into sending more or less arbitrary data to any TCP port. This can be used to send commands to servers using ASCII based protocols like SMTP, NNTP, POP3, IMAP, IRC, and others. By sending HTML email to unsuspecting users or using a trojan HTML page, an attacker might be able to send mail or post Usenet News through servers normally not accessible to him. In special cases an attacker might be able to do other harm, e.g. deleting mail from a POP3 mailbox.

		* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) are two attackmethods that enable attackers to cross network boundaries in order to attack applications,but can only target applications that speak HTTP. Custom TCP protocols are everywhere:IoT devices, smartphones, databases, development software, internal web applications, andmore. Often, these applications assume that no security is necessary because they are onlyaccessible over the local network. This paper aims to be a definitive overview of attacksthat allow cross-protocol exploitation of non-HTTP listeners using CSRF and SSRF, and alsoexpands on the state of the art in these types of attacks to target length-specified protocolsthat were not previously thought to be exploitable.

			* This presentation will examine the largely underresearched topic of rich internet applications (RIAs) security in the hopes of illustrating how the complex interactions with their executing environment, and general bad security practices, can lead to exploitable applications. In recent years rich internet applications (RIAs) have become the mainstay of large internet applications and are becoming increasingly attractive to the industry due to their similarity to desktop applications. Furthermore their user of exsting web technologies such as HTTP, HTML/XML and Javascript/Actionscript make them attractive options to companies with existing web developers. Unfortunately the use of existing technologies brings with it the burden of existing ways to write vulnerable code, but adds yet more ways. This presentation will examine the largely underresearched topic of RIA security in the hopes of illustrating how the complex interactions with their executing environment, and general bad security practices, can lead to exploitable applications.

			* In this paper, we examine the attack surface that remainsafter XSS and similar scripting attacks are supposedly mit-igated by preventing an attacker from executing JavaScriptcode. We address the question of whether an attacker reallyneeds JavaScript or similar functionality to perform attacksaiming for information theft. The surprising result is thatan attacker can also abuse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) incombination with other Web techniques like plain HTML,inactive SVG images or font files.  Through several casestudies, we introduce the so calledscriptless attacksanddemonstrate that an adversary might not need to executecode to preserve his ability to extract sensitive informationfrom well protected websites. More precisely, we show thatan attacker can use seemingly benign features to build sidechannel attacks that measure and exfiltrate almost arbitrarydata displayed on a given website.We conclude this paper with a discussion of potential mit-igation techniques against this class of attacks. In addition,we have implemented a browser patch that enables a websiteto make a vital determination as to being loaded in a de-tached view or pop-up window. This approach proves usefulfor prevention of certain types of attacks we here discuss.

		* When caching servers and load balancers became an integral part of the Internet's infrastructure, vendors introduced what is called "Edge Side Includes" (ESI), a technology allowing malleability in caching systems. This legacy technology, still implemented in nearly all popular HTTP surrogates (caching/load balancing services), is dangerous by design and brings a yet unexplored vector for web-based attacks.

		* Most people are familiar with homograph attacks due to phishing or other attack campaigns using Internationalized Domain Names with look-alike characters. But homograph attacks exist against wide variety of systems that have gotten far less attention. This talk discusses the use of homographs to attack machine learning systems, to submit malicious software patches, and to craft cryptographic canary traps and leak repudiation mechanisms. It then introduces a generalized defense strategy that should work against homograph attacks in any context.

		* Web homograph attacks have existed for some time, and the recent adoption of International Domain Names (IDNs) support by browsers and DNS registrars has exacerbated the problem [Gabr02]. Many international letters have similar glyphs, such as the Cyrillic letter P (lower case 'er,' Unicode 0x0440) and the Latin letter p. Because of the large potential for misuse of IDNs, browser vendors, policy advocates, and researchers have been exploring techniques for mitigating homograph attacks [=Mozi05, Appl05, Oper05, Mark05]. There has been plenty of attention on the problem recently, but we are not aware of any data that quantifies the degree to which Web homograph attacks are currently taking place. In this paper, we use a combination of passive network tracing and active DNS probing to measure several aspects of Web homographs. Our main findings are four-fold. First, many authoritative Web sites that users visit have several confusable domain names registered. Popular Web sites are much more likely to have such confusable domains registered. Second, registered confusable domain names tend to consist of single character substitutions from their authoritative domains, though we saw instances of five-character substitutions. Most confusables currently use Latin character homographs, but we did find a non-trivial number of IDN homographs. Third, Web sites associated with non-authoritative confusable domains most commonly show users advertisements. Less common functions include redirecting victims to competitor sites and spoofing the content of authoritative site. Fourth, during our nine-day trace, none of the 828 Web clients we observed visited a non-authoritative confusable Web site. Overall, our measurement results suggest that homograph attacks currently are rare and not severe in nature. However, given the recent increases in phishing incidents, homograph attacks seem like an attractive future method for attackers to lure users to spoofed sites.

	* [FUSE: Finding File Upload Bugs via Penetration Testing - Taekjin Lee, Seongil Wi, Suyoung Lee, Sooel Son(NDSS2020)]()
		* An Unrestricted File Upload (UFU) vulnerability is a critical security threat that enables an adversary to upload her choice of a forged file to a target web server. This bug evolves into an Unrestricted Executable File Upload (UEFU) vulnerability when the adversary is able to conduct remote code execution of the uploaded file via triggering its URL. We design and implement FUSE, the first penetration testing tool designed to discover UFU and UEFU vulnerabilities in server-side PHP web applications. The goal of FUSE is to generate upload requests; each request becomes an exploit payload that triggers a UFU or UEFU vulnerability. However, this approach entails two technical challenges: (1) it should generate an upload request that bypasses all content-filtering checks present in a target web application; and (2) it should preserve the execution semantic of the resulting uploaded file. We address these technical challenges by mutating standard upload requests with carefully designed mutation operations that enable the bypassing of content- filtering checks and do not tamper with the execution of uploaded files. FUSE discovered 30 previously unreported UEFU vulnerabilities, including 15 CVEs from 33 real-world web applications, thereby demonstrating its efficacy in finding code execution bugs via file uploads.

It was first documented in 2005, and was again repopularized by PortSwigger's research.

		* HTTP requests are traditionally viewed as isolated, standalone entities. In this session, I'll introduce techniques for remote, unauthenticated attackers to smash through this isolation and splice their requests into others, through which I was able to play puppeteer with the web infrastructure of numerous commercial and military systems, rain exploits on their visitors, and harvest over $50k in bug bounties.  Using these targets as case studies, I’ll show you how to delicately amend victim's requests to route them into malicious territory, invoke harmful responses, and lure credentials into your open arms. I’ll also demonstrate using backend reassembly on your own requests to exploit every modicum of trust placed on the frontend, gain maximum privilege access to internal APIs, poison web caches, and compromise my favourite login page.  Although documented over a decade ago, a fearsome reputation for difficulty and collateral damage has left this attack optimistically ignored for years while the web's susceptibility grew. By applying fresh ideas and new techniques, I’ll unveil a vast expanse of vulnerable systems ranging from huge content delivery networks to bespoke backends, and ensure you leave equipped to devise your own desync techniques and tailor attacks to your target of choice.

		* HTTP is everywhere, everybody wants to write an HTTP server. So I wrote mine :-) But mine not fast, and come with an HTTP client which sends very bad HTTP queries. My tool is a stress tester for HTTP servers and proxies, and I wrote it because I found flaws in all HTTP agents that I have checked in the last year i.e. nodejs, golang, Apache httpd, FreeBSD http, Nginx, Varnish and even Haproxy. This presentation will try to explain how flaws in HTTP parsers can be exploited for bad things; we'll play with HTTP to inject unexpected content in the user browser, or perform actions in his name. If you know nothing about HTTP it should be understandable, but you'll have to trust me blindly at the end. If you think you know HTTP, you have no reason to avoid this talk. Then, the short part, I will show you this new Open Source stress tool that I wrote and hope that you will remember it when you'll write your own HTTP parser for you new f** language.

		* Browsers are complicated enough to have attack surface beyond memory safety issues. This talk will look into injection flaws in the user interface of Mozilla Firefox, which is implemented in JS, HTML, and an XML-dialect called XUL. With an Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the user interface attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the main browser application process. This allows for cross-platform exploits of high reliability. The talk discusses past vulnerabilities and will also suggest mitigations that benefit Single Page Applications and other platforms that may suffer from DOM-based XSS, like Electron.

			* NoSQL databases continue to grow in popularity due to their scalability, dynamic data structures, ease of development and cloud readiness. As these types of databases become more prevalent, penetration testers need to understand how these databases work, how applications interact with them, and where the inherent weaknesses of NoSQL databases are. This presentation is targeted towards penetration testers and putting the theoretical attacks researchers have discussed into practice during a penetration testing engagement. It will discuss weaknesses with a particular focus on MongoDB and how to quickly and easily exploit them as well as where the high value targets in the system are post exploitation. NoSQLMap, a Python tool written for automatically stealing data from NoSQL database servers and web applications, will also be demoed.

			* The days of selecting from a few SQL database options for an application are over. There is now a plethora of NoSQL database options to choose from: some are better than others for certain jobs. There are good reasons why developers are choosing them over traditional SQL databases including performance, scalabiltiy, and ease-of-use. Unfortunately like for many hot techologies, security is largely an afterthought in NoSQL databases. This short but concise presentation will illustrate how poor the quality of security in many NoSQL database systems is. This presentation will not be confined to one particular NoSQL database system. Two sets of security issues will be discussed: those that affect all NoSQL database systems such as defaults, authentication, encryption; and those that affect specific NoSQL database systems such as MongoDB and CouchDB. The ideas that we now have a complicated heterogeneous problem and that defense-in-depth is even more necessary will be stressed. There is a common misconception that SQL injection attacks are eliminated by using a NoSQL database system. While specifically SQL injection is largely eliminated, injection attack vectors have increased thanks to JavaScript and the flexibility of NoSQL databases. This presentation will present and demo new classes of injection attacks. Attendees should be familiar with JavaScript and JSON.

			* NoSQL data storage systems have become very popular due to their scalability and ease of use. This paper examines the maturity of security measures for NoSQL databases, addressing their new query and access mechanisms. For example the emergence of new query formats makes the old SQL injection techniques irrelevant, but are NoSQL databases immune to injection in general? The answer is NO. Here we present a few techniques for attacking NoSQL databases such as injections and CSRF. We analyze the source of these vulnerabilities and present methodologies to mitigate the attacks. We show that this new vibrant technological area lacks the security measures and awareness which havedeveloped over the years in traditional RDBMSSQL systems.

		* RPO (Relative Path Overwrite) is a technique to take advantage of relative URLs by overwriting their target file. To understand the technique we must first look into the differences between relative and absolute URLs. An absolute URL is basically the full URL for a destination address including the protocol and domain name whereas a relative URL doesn’t specify a domain or protocol and uses the existing destination to determine the protocol and domain.

The main driver program takes a user-specified command and wraps it in the user-specified gadget chain, then serializes these objects to stdout. When an application with the required gadgets on the classpath unsafely deserializes this data, the chain will automatically be invoked and cause the command to be executed on the application host.

			* Object deserialization is an established but poorly understood attack vector in applications that is disturbingly prevalent across many languages, platforms, formats, and libraries. In January 2015 at AppSec California, Chris Frohoff and Gabe Lawrence gave a talk on this topic, covering deserialization vulnerabilities across platforms, the many forms they take, and places they can be found. It covered, among other things, somewhat novel techniques using classes in commonly used libraries for attacking Java serialization that were subsequently released in the form of the ysoserial tool. Few people noticed until late 2015, when other researchers used these techniques/tools to exploit well known products such as Bamboo, WebLogic, WebSphere, ApacheMQ, and Jenkins, and then services such as PayPal. Since then, the topic has gotten some long-overdue attention and great work is being done by many to improve our understanding and developer awareness on the subject. This talk will review the details of Java deserialization exploit techniques and mitigations, as well as report on some of the recent (and future) activity in this area.

As many Oracle products are based on Java, deserialization bugs are found in many Oracle environments especially those using Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Fusion Middleware, and Oracle E-Business Suite. As an example, in November 2015 Oracle released an out-of-cycle security fix (CVE-2015-4852) in order to fix a deserialization bug in Oracle WebLogic. This education webinar provides an understanding of Java deserialization vulnerabilities, the potential impact for Oracle environments, and strategies to protect an Oracle environment from this class of security vulnerabilities.

			* Insecure deserialization was recently added to OWASP's list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks, yet it is by no means a new vulnerability category. For years, data serialization and deserialization have been used in applications, services and frameworks, with many programming languages supporting them natively. Deserialization got more attention recently as a potential vehicle to conduct several types of attacks: data tampering, authentication bypass, privilege escalation, various injections and, ultimately, remote code execution. Two prominent vulnerabilities in Apache Commons and Apache Struts, both allowing remote code execution, also contributed to raising awareness of this risk. We will discuss how data serialization and deserialization are used in software, the dangers of deserializing untrusted input, and how to avoid insecure deserialization vulnerabilities. The presentation will contain several code examples with live demos of bypassing security controls due to incorrect deserialization. The examples and demos will use Java and its native serialization, but the techniques can be extrapolated to other languages and formats.

Most importantly, we'll discuss several best practices and countermeasures you can use as a developer to protect yourself from these issues – or prevent them from affecting you in the first place.

For years, data serialization and deserialization have been used in applications, services and frameworks, with many programming languages supporting them natively. Deserialization got more attention recently as a potential vehicle to conduct several types of attacks: data tampering, authentication bypass, privilege escalation, various injections and, ultimately, remote code execution. Two prominent vulnerabilities in Apache Commons and Apache Struts, both allowing remote code execution, also contributed to raising awareness of this risk. We will discuss how data serialization and deserialization are used in software, the dangers of deserializing untrusted input, and how to avoid insecure deserialization vulnerabilities. The presentation will contain several code examples with live demos of bypassing security controls due to incorrect deserialization. The examples and demos will use Java and its native serialization, but the techniques can be extrapolated to other languages and formats.

			* Object serialization technologies allow programs to easily convert in-memory objects to and from various binary and textual data formats for storage or transfer – but with great power comes great responsibility, because deserializing objects from untrusted data can ruin your day. We will look at historical and modern vulnerabilities across different languages and serialization technologies, including Python, Ruby, and Java, and show how to exploit these issues to achieve code execution. We will also cover some strategies to protect applications from these types of attacks.

In this talk, we will bat around the principle and exploit technique of these vulnerabilities. Also, we will present how to pwn target server by our new exploit technique. It can not only improve the effect of java deserialization vulnerability but also enhance other Java security issues impact, and we will discuss profound impacts of the attack vector in the java security field.

			* 2016 was the year of Java deserialization apocalypse. Although Java Deserialization attacks were known for years, the publication of the Apache Commons Collection Remote Code Execution gadget (RCE from now on) finally brought this forgotten vulnerability to the spotlight and motivated the community to start finding and fixing these issues. .NET is next in line; formatters such as BinaryFormatter and NetDataContractSerializer are known to share similar mechanics which make them potentially vulnerable to similar RCE attacks. However, as we saw with Java before, the lack of RCE gadgets led some software vendors to not take this issue seriously. In this talk, we will analyze .NET serializers including third party JSON parsers for potential RCE vectors. We will provide real-world examples of vulnerable code and more importantly, we will review how these vulnerabilities were detected and fixed in each case.
		* [Friday the 13th: Attacking JSON - Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh(AppSecUSA 2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqHsaVhlxAQ)
			* 2016 was the year of Java deserialization apocalypse. Although Java Deserialization attacks were known for years, the publication of the Apache Commons Collection Remote Code Execution (RCE from now on) gadget finally brought this forgotten vulnerability to the spotlight and motivated the community to start finding and fixing these issues. One of the most suggested solutions for avoiding Java deserialization issues was to move away from Java Deserialization altogether and use safer formats such as JSON. In this talk, we will analyze the most popular JSON parsers in both .NET and Java for potential RCE vectors. We will demonstrate that RCE is also possible in these libraries and present details about the ones that are vulnerable to RCE by default. We will also discuss common configurations that make other libraries vulnerable. In addition to focusing on JSON format, we will generalize the attack techniques to other serialization formats. In particular, we will pay close attention to several serialization formats in .NET. These formats have also been known to be vulnerable since 2012 but the lack of known RCE gadgets led some software vendors to not take this issue seriously. We hope this talk will change this. With the intention of bringing the due attention to this vulnerability class in .NET, we will review the known vulnerable formats, present other formats which we found to be vulnerable as well and conclude presenting several gadgets from system libraries that may be used to achieve RCE in a stable way: no memory corruption -- just simple process invocation. Finally, we will provide recommendations on how to determine if your code is vulnerable, provide remediation advice, and discuss alternative approaches.

		* Bit errors in computer memory, when they occur in a stored domain name, can cause Internet traffic to be directed to the wrong Internet location potentially compromising security. When a domain name one bit different from a target domain is registered, this is called "bitsquatting". This presentation builds on previous work in this area presented by Artem Dinaburg at Blackhat 2011. Cisco's research into bitsquatting has revealed several previously unknown vectors for bitsquatting. Cisco has also discovered several new mitigations which do not involve installation of error correcting memory, nor the mass registration of bitsquat domains. In fact some of the new mitigations have the potential to render the problem of bitsquatting to the dustbin of history.

		* Due to their high practical impact, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks have attracted a lot of attention from the security community members. In the same way, a plethora of more or less effective defense techniques have been proposed, addressing the causes and effects of XSS vulnerabilities. As a result, an adversary often can no longer inject or even execute arbitrary scripting code in several real-life scenarios. In this paper, we examine the attack surface that remains after XSS and similar scripting attacks are supposedly mitigated by preventing an attacker from executing JavaScript code. We address the question of whether an attacker really needs JavaScript or similar functionality to perform attacks aiming for information theft. The surprising result is that an attacker can also abuse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in combination with other Web techniques like plain HTML, inactive SVG images or font files. Through several case studies, we introduce the so called scriptless attacks and demonstrate that an adversary might not need to execute code to preserve his ability to extract sensitive informati on from well protected websites. More precisely, we show that an attacker can use seemingly benign features to build side channel attacks that measure and exfiltrate almost arbitrary data displayed on a given website. We conclude this paper with a discussion of potential mitigation techniques against this class of attacks. In addition, we have implemented a browser patch that enables a website to make a vital determination as to being loaded in a detached view or pop-up window. This approach proves useful for prevention of certain types of attacks we here discuss.

				* This talk is about the DOM and its more twilight areas. Well see the weird parts and talk about where and why this might be security critical and affect your precious online applications, browser extensions or packaged apps. To understand the foundations of what the DOM has become by today, we'll further explore the historical parts - who created the DOM, what was the intention and how fought dirty about it during the browser wars.  Finally, we'll see a DOM based attack called "DOM Clobbering". An attack, that is everything but obvious and affected a very popular and commonly used Rich Text Editor. Be prepared for a lot of tech-talk as well as fear and loathing in the browser window. But don't shed no tears, there's a tool that fixes the security crazy for you and this talk will present it.

				* Over the years many techniques have been introduced to prevent or mitigate XSS. Thereby, most of these techniques such as HTML sanitizers or CSP focus on script tags and event handlers. In this talk, we present a novel Web hacking technique that enables an attacker to bypass these mitigations. In order to to so, the attacker abuses so-called script gadgets. A gadget Is a legitimate piece of JS in a page that reads elements via selectors and processes them in a way that results in script execution. To abuse a gadget, the attacker injects benign elements that match the gadget&rsquo;s selector. Subsequently, the gadget selects the elements and executes the attacker's scripts. As the attacker's markup is benign it passes HTML sanitizers and security policies. The XSS only surfaces when the gadget mistakenly elevates the privileges of the element. Based on real-world examples, we will demonstrate that these gadgets are present in almost all modern JavaScript libraries, APIs and applications.

				* JavaScript cruft is growing faster than my ability to read. Since I can't read every line of code, I need tools to find important lines. Eval Villain is a web extension for Firefox that hooks native JavaScript functions *before* the page loads so that you will be notified every time a function is called. Eval Villain has discovered instances of DOM XSS that only appear in 1 of 100 page loads. It makes the reversing of malicious, second-stage encrypted JavaScript code trivial. I plan on walking through all the features of this tool using examples. To follow along, bring a computer that can run Firefox.https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidescleveland2019/bsides-cleveland-c-00-eval-villain-simplifying-dom-xss-and-js-reversing-dennis-goodlett

					* Back in 2007, Hasegawa discovered a novel Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vector based on the mistreatment of the backtick character in a single browser implementation. This initially looked like an implementation error that could easily be fixed. Instead, as this paper shows, it was the first example of a new class of XSS vectors, the class of mutation-based XSS (mXSS) vectors, which may occur in innerHTML and related properties. mXSS affects all three major browser families: IE, Firefox, and Chrome. We were able to place stored mXSS vectors in high-profile applications like Yahoo! Mail, Rediff Mail, OpenExchange, Zimbra, Roundcube, and several commercial products. mXSS vectors bypassed widely deployed server-side XSS protection techniques (like HTML Purifier, kses, htmlLawed, Blueprint and Google Caja), client-side filters (XSS Auditor, IE XSS Filter), Web Application Firewall (WAF) systems, as well as Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS). We describe a scenario in which seemingly immune entities are being rendered prone to an attack based on the behavior of an involved party, in our case the browser. Moreover, it proves very difficult to mitigate these attacks: In browser implementations, mXSS is closely related to performance enhancements applied to the HTML code before rendering; in server side filters, strict filter rules would break many web applications since the mXSS vectors presented in this paper are harmless when sent to the browser. This paper introduces and discusses a set of seven different subclasses of mXSS attacks, among which only one was previously known. The work evaluates the attack surface, showcases examples of vulnerable high-profile applications, and provides a set of practicable and low-overhead solutions to defend against these kinds of attacks.
				* [Automation of Mutated Cross Site Scripting - Anchal Tiwari, J. Jeysree](https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v4i4/SUB152876.pdf)	
					* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. In browsers Mutation event occur when there is a change in the DOM Structure of the browsers. There are various ways in which DOM structure could be changed among which innerHTML property is discussed specifically. mXSS is a new class of XSS vectors, the class of mutation-based XSS (mXSS) vectors, which may occur in innerHTML andrelated properties. mXSS affects all three major browserfamilies: IE, Firefox, and Chrome.mXSS could be placed in major browser families and effecting major web applications. In this paper we apply the idea of mutation-based testing technique to generate adequate test data sets for testing XSSVs. Our work addresses XSSVs related to web-applications that use PHP and JavaScript code to generate dynamic HTML contents. Finally there would be the development of an automatic tool which would generate mutants automatically, automatically testing the web application and finally giving the output.

As the user was originally on the correct page they are less likely to notice that it has been changed to a phishing site, especially it the site looks the same as the target. If the user authenticates to this new page then their credentials (or other sensitive data) are sent to the phishing site rather than the legitimate one.

		* We present the first formulation of a happens-before relation for common web platform features. Developing this relation was a non-trivial task, due to complex feature interactions and browser differences. We also present a logical memory access model for web applications that abstracts away browser implementation details. Based on the above, we implemented WEBRACER, the first dynamic race detector for web applications. WEBRACER is implemented atop the production-quality WebKit engine, enabling testing of full-featured web sites. WEBRACER can also simulate certain user actions, exposing more races. We evaluated WEBRACER by testing a large set of Fortune 100 company web sites. We discovered many harmful races, and also gained insights into how developers handle asynchrony in practice.

		* Web cache deception (WCD) is an attack proposed in 2017, where an attacker tricks a caching proxy into erroneously storing private information transmitted over the Internet and subsequently gains unauthorized access to that cached data. Due to the widespread use of web caches and, in particular, the use of massive networks of caching proxies deployed by content distribution network (CDN) providers as a critical component of the Internet, WCD puts a substantial population of Internet users at risk. We present the first large-scale study that quantifies the prevalence of WCD in 340 high-profile sites among the Alexa Top 5K. Our analysis reveals WCD vulnerabilities that leak private user data as well as secret authentication and authorization tokens that can be leveraged by an attacker to mount damaging web application attacks. Furthermore, we explore WCD in a scientific framework as an instance of the path confusion class of attacks, and demonstrate that variations on the path confusion technique used make it possible to exploit sites that are otherwise not impacted by the original attack. Our findings show that many popular sites remain vulnerable two years after the public disclosure of WCD. Our empirical experiments with popular CDN providers underline the fact that web caches are not plug & play technologies. In order to mitigate WCD, site operators must adopt a holistic view of their web infrastructure and carefully configure cache settings appropriate for their applications.

		* Web Cache Deception attack is a new web attack vector that puts various technologies and frameworks at risk. By manipulating behaviors of web servers and caching mechanisms, anonymous attackers can expose sensitive information of authenticated application users, and in certain cases to even take control over their accounts.

		* Web Cache Deception (WCD) has been introduced in 2017 by Omer Gil, where an intruder lures a caching server to mistakenly store private information publicly and as a result obtains unauthorized access to cached data. In this talk, we will introduce new exploitation techniques based on the semantic disconnect among different framework-independent web technologies (e.g., browsers, CDNs, web servers) which results in different URL path interpretations. We coined the term ‚ÄúPath Confusion‚Äù to represent this disagreement and we will present the effectiveness of this technique on WCD attack. In February 2020, our related research was voted and led to an award as the top web hacking technique of 2019 by PortSwigger.   We explore WCD as an instance of the path confusion class of attacks, and demonstrate that variations on the path confusion technique make it possible to exploit sites that are otherwise not impacted by the original attack. Our findings show that many popular sites remain vulnerable three years after the public disclosure of WCD. To further elucidate the seriousness of path confusion, we will also present the large scale analysis results of WCD attack on high profile sites. We present a semi-automated path confusion crawler which detects hundreds of sites that are still vulnerable to WCD only with specific types of path confusion techniques. We conclude the talk with explaining why path confusion is so complicated to remediate while shedding light on potential areas that researchers and bughunters can apply new attack vectors through different path confusion techniques.

				* Web application testers of our time have lots of tools at their disposal. Some of these offer the option to be extended in ways the original developers did not think of, thus making their tool more useful. However, developing extensions or plugins have entry barriers in the form of fixed costs, boilerplate, et cetera. At the same time, many problems already have a solution designed as a smaller standalone program, which could be combined in the Unix fashion to produce a useful complex tool quickly and easily. In this paper, a (meta)solution is introduced for this integration problem by lowering the entry barriers and offer several examples that demonstrate how it saved time in web application assessments.
