			* From an attacker’s perspective, configuration adjustments provide interesting opportunities for living-off-the-land-binary (lolbin) execution. In this short post, we’ll highlight a technique for turning pretty much any .NET executable into an opportunistic lolbin that abuses .NET development features by overriding Global Assembly Cache (GAC) path lookups. Furthermore, we’ll examine several defensive considerations for detecting malicious use of the presented technique.

			* Two of the biggest challenges of long-term penetration tests are advanced security products and active administrators. Host intrusion prevention, application white-listing and antivirus software are all looking for your tools. Administrators and network defenders are doing everything they can to find you. Surprisingly, the easiest way to hide from them and homestead in a Windows enterprise is to live off the land. Microsoft provides you with all the tools you need to get into a network and live there forever. Tools such as Wmic, Netsh and PowerShell are well-known to administrators, but they also provide an attacker a whole range of virtually untapped features. By simply leveraging PowerSploit and a few tricks you can reliably bypass antivirus, get around whitelisting, escalate privileges, redirect network traffic, take full packet captures, log keystrokes, take screenshots, dump hashes, persist and pivot to other hosts all without introducing a single binary!

			* There are several languages and methods used to execute code on a computer system, such as C#, Powershell, Python, VBA, and many more. The defense is getting better, which has caused the offense to adapt and look for innovative ways to “live off the land”. One area that has not been explored deeply is utilizing tools that the Java Development Kit (JDK) provides. According to a statement by Oracle, Java runs on 3 billion devices. Enterprises depend on Java running on their user endpoints and servers in order to keep their businesses running. This makes using tools installed with the JDK very enticing to attackers. This talk will explore using JDK command-line scripting tools and the Nashorn Javascript Engine to perform several actions, such as downloading files, executing scripts locally and remotely, and gaining a remote interactive shell to a computer system. Detective and preventive controls will also be discussed for the usage of these JDK scripting tools.

			* You've compromised that initial server and gained a foothold in the target network: congratulations! But wait - the shadow file has no hashes but root, the ssh keys have strong passphrases, and all the interesting traffic is encrypted - there's nothing of value here! Or is there? In this talk, I will explore post-exploitation techniques for turning your compromised bastion hosts into active credential interceptors under a variety of blue team monitoring scenarios.

			* You have probably heard the term LOLBin, LOLScript or LOLLib by now. Want to get more insights on that? Then this is the talk you want to attend.This talk will cover the Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS) project, what the project is, how it became and how you can help this evolve into the future. The talk will also go over some of my favorite LOLBins that has came to light due to this project (at least that's what I like to think) and show you some cool stuff! I mean, everybody loves to see binaries misbehave.
		* [Covert Attack Mystery Box: A few novel techniques for exploiting Microsoft "features" - Mike Felch and Beau Bullock (WWHF2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFk-b0aT6cs)
			* Over the last few months we’ve been doing a bit of research around various Microsoft “features”, and have mined a few interesting nuggets that you might find useful if you’re trying to be covert on your red team engagements. This talk will be “mystery surprise box” style as we’ll be weaponizing some things for the first time. There will be demos and new tools presented during the talk. So, if you want to win at hide-n-seek with the blue team, come get your covert attack mystery box!

It attempts to provide offsec personnel a tool with the ability to identify and leverage these non-technical vulnerabilities. As always: use for good, promote security, and fight application propagation.

			* Offensive PowerShell tradecraft is in “Zombie Mode”: it’s sort of dead, but not entirely. With all of the defenses Microsoft has implemented in the PowerShell runtime over the past few years Red Teamers / Pentesters & APT groups have started too shy away from using PowerShell based payloads/delivery mechanisms and migrate over to C#. However, C# is a compiled language. Operationally this has a few major downsides: we can’t be as “flexible” as setting up a proper development environment has an overhead and can be time consuming and you have to compile all the things all the time etc.

					* Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) project files lie at the heart of the build and deployment process. This topic starts with a conceptual overview of MSBuild and the project file. It describes the key components you'll come across when you work with project files, and it works through an example of how you can use project files to deploy real-world applications.

This technique doesn’t leave any artifacts since it doesn’t touch the disk and the code is injected into a legitimate Windows process Internet Explorer.

				* Back in July I documented a new Citrix Workspace vulnerability that allowed attackers to remotely execute arbitrary commands under the SYSTEM account.  Well after some further investigation on the initial fix I discovered a new vector that quite frankly should not exist at all since the previous reported vulnerability.  The core of the issue lies with a remote command line injection vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass Citrix signed MSI installers using a malicious MSI transform.
			* [PwnyForm](https://github.com/CCob/PwnyForm)
				* PwnyForm will take an MSI installer as input and generate an MSI transform (mst) that can be used to inject arbitrary command execution by adding a custom action that will execute during the UI or Install sequence of an MSI file. The generated MST produces a JScript custom action that will by default launch cmd.exe, the executed command can be overriden using the CMD MSI property

				* Many programmers are familiar with the Windows "Win32" API that provides access to a large variety of services, from user interface to memory management; but far fewer have much idea about the Windows "Native" API which is the mechanism used to access the operating system services located in the kernel.  While it is rare to need to use these services directly (since the Win32 API provides a richer, better supported, and documented interface) it can be very useful to have some understanding of what is going on 'under the covers' inside this API.  I will look at the Native API from the application programmer’s point of view and will also touch on how Microsoft provides a 32bit subsystem in the 64bit version of Windows.  I hope this session will be of interest to all those who like to know more about how things work!

				* Windows APIs are often a blackbox with poor documentation, taking input and spewing output with little visibility on what actually happens in the background. By reverse engineering (and abusing) some of these seemingly benign APIs, we can effectively manipulate Windows into performing stealthy custom attacks using previously unknown persistent and injection techniques. In this talk, we’ll get Windows to play with itself nonstop while revealing 0day persistence, previously unknown DLL injection techniques, and Windows API tips and tricks. To top it all off, a custom HTTP beaconing backdoor will be released leveraging the newly released persistence and injection techniques. So much Windows abuse, so little time.

This seems to be a technique favoured by many APT's and Red Teams given the lack of detection by lots of anti-malware technology. The sample attempts to inject shellcode which transpires to be a Cobalt Strike beacon which uses Domain Fronting to access its C2.

					* "My solution to this is a small python script, based upon Ero's pefile, that creates an IDC declaration of an IDA enumeration for each DLL. The enum serves as a mapping between each exported name and its hash. Since the API hashing function may change, the Python function to do this is extensible via a function pointer which defaults to the standard hash presented above."
				* [BlobRunner](https://github.com/OALabs/BlobRunner)
					* BlobRunner is a simple tool to quickly debug shellcode extracted during malware analysis. BlobRunner allocates memory for the target file and jumps to the base (or offset) of the allocated memory. This allows an analyst to quickly debug into extracted artifacts with minimal overhead and effort.

					* The general idea behind an architecture spanning shellcode is trying to come up with a sequence of bytes that would execute a jump instruction on one architecture while executing a nop-like instruction on another architecture. That way we can branch to architecture specific code depending on the platform our code is running on.

				 	* Here are the slides and code for my recent presentation at Ekoparty 2016. The full abstract can be found below. In brief, this research involved automatically generating shellcodes when there are restrictions on legal encodings. We explore examples ranging from well-known ones (no NULL bytes, no '%' character, printable, alphanumeric, all letters uppercase, etc.) to weird and challenging ones (bytes must alternate even and odd, no duplicate bytes, all words are prime numbers, etc). We also explore automated encoding and decoder generation: e.g., given some existing shellcode, transform it into (for example) alphanumeric bytes, and generate a decoder to revert the encoding at run-time. We also explore tasks like finding the shortest or longest solutions, re-writing existing shellcodes into a given encoding, exploiting known facts about the input state, and integration with automated exploit generation.

						* Metasploit x86 shellcode has been defeated by EMET and other techniques not only in exploit payloads but through using those payloads in non-exploit situations (e.g. binary payload generation, PowerShell deployment, etc..). This talk describes taking Metasploit payloads (minus Stephen Fewer's hash API), incorporating techniques to bypass Caller/EAF[+] checks (post ASLR/DEP bypass) and merging those techniques together with automation to make something better.

						* [Slides](https://github.com/chrismaddalena/Presentations/tree/master/2017%20DerbyCon)
						* If you have ever worked with an exploit or Metasploit, you have probably used shellcode, but do you know how it is made? This talk has been designed to walk you through the ins and outs of basic shellcode, with a focus on Windows and the x86 architecture. There will be a review of the basic computer science behind shellcode, a look under the hood of msfvenom works and how you can recreate msfvenom’s shellcode in Assembly, and then a walkthrough and a demo of how you can create a custom connectback stager using Assembly.
				* **Tools**
					* [Donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut)
						* Generates x86, x64, or AMD64+x86 position-independent shellcode that loads .NET Assemblies, PE files, and other Windows payloads from memory and runs them with parameters
					* [Venom](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/venom)
						* The script will use msfvenom (metasploit) to generate shellcode in diferent formats ( `C#, python, ruby, dll, msi, hta-psh, docm, apk, macho, elf, deb, mp4, etc` ) injects the shellcode generated into one template (example: python) "the python funtion will execute the shellcode into ram" and uses compilers like gcc (gnu cross compiler) or mingw32 or pyinstaller to build the executable file. It also starts a multi-handler to recive the remote connection (shell or meterpreter session). 'venom generator' reproduces some of the technics used by Veil-Evasion.py, unicorn.py, powersploit.py, etc..
					* [Cross Arch Shellcode Compiler](https://github.com/ixty/xarch_shellcode)

					* [Shellsploit](https://github.com/vasco2016/shellsploit-framework)
						* Shellsploit let's you generate customized shellcodes, backdoors, injectors for various operating system. And let's you obfuscation every byte via encoders.
					* [Shellcode Compiler](https://github.com/NytroRST/ShellcodeCompiler)
						* Shellcode Compiler is a program that compiles C/C++ style code into a small, position-independent and NULL-free shellcode for Windows (x86 and x64) and Linux (x86 and x64). It is possible to call any Windows API function or Linux syscall in a user-friendly way.

Effectively, it abuses native Windows function calls to transfer execution to shellcode that it loads into memory. I thought it was cool in this context, and not something that I was super familiar with, even though I've since learned it's a very old technique, so I set out to do some research in identifying additional functions that could be abused in a similar way and how to leverage them

							* [Slides](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-06/BH-US-06-Sutton.pdf)
							* "Injecting shellcode into a vulnerable program so you can find it reliably can be tricky. With image format vulnerabilities, sometimes the only place you can put your code is in the image itself. If a file attempting to exploit one of these vulnerabilities was rendered using a non-vulnerable application, the ‘strange’ files might raise some suspicion; a file containing a NOP-sled and shellcode does not tend to look like any normal photo. What if shellcode could be injected in this way without significantly altering the appearance of the file? What if the entire file could be transformed into executable code but the original image or sound could still be rendered? In this presentation we will present Punk Ode, which combines concepts from steganography, psychophysics and restricted character-set shellcode encoding to hide shellcode in plain sight. We will discuss how to convert a media file into a stream of valid instructions while leaving the initial images/sounds intact so as not to raise suspicion. We will also release a series of tools designed to automate the generation of such files.

			* [Abusing Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) - Matthew Graeber(BH USA 2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SjMgnGwpq8)
				* Imagine a technology that is built into every Windows operating system going back to Windows 95, runs as System, executes arbitrary code, persists across reboots, and does not drop a single file to disk. Such a thing does exist and it's called Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). With increased scrutiny from anti-virus and 'next-gen' host endpoints, advanced red teams and attackers already know that the introduction of binaries into a high-security environment is subject to increased scrutiny. WMI enables an attacker practicing a minimalist methodology to blend into their target environment without dropping a single utility to disk. WMI is also unlike other persistence techniques in that rather than executing a payload at a predetermined time, WMI conditionally executes code asynchronously in response to operating system events. This talk will introduce WMI and demonstrate its offensive uses. We will cover what WMI is, how attackers are currently using it in the wild, how to build a full-featured backdoor, and how to detect and prevent these attacks from occurring.

				* When exploiting software vulnerabilities it is sometimes impossible to build direct communication channels between a target machine and an attacker's machine due to restrictive outbound filters that may be in place on the target machine's network. Bypassing these filters involves creating a post-exploitation payload that is capable of masquerading as normal user traffic from within the context of a trusted process. One method of accomplishing this is to create a payload that enables ActiveX controls by modifying Internet Explorer's zone restrictions. With ActiveX controls enabled, the payload can then launch a hidden instance of Internet Explorer that is pointed at a URL with an embedded ActiveX control. The end result is the ability for an attacker to run custom code in the form of a DLL on a target machine by using a trusted process that uses one or more trusted communication protocols, such as HTTP or DNS.

				* Remote Command Execution as SYSTEM on Windows IoT Core; The method is exploiting the Sirep Test Service that’s built in and running on the official images offered at Microsoft’s site. This service is the client part of the HLK setup one may build in order to perform driver/hardware tests on the IoT device. It serves the Sirep/WPCon/TShell protocol. We broke down the Sirep/WPCon protocol and demonstrated how this protocol exposes a remote command interface for attackers, that include RAT abilities such as get/put arbitrary files on arbitrary locations and obtain system information. Based on the findings we have extracted from this research about the service and protocol, we built a simple python tool that allows exploiting them using the different supported commands. We called it SirepRAT. It features an easy and intuitive user interface for sending commands to a Windows IoT Core target. It works on any cable-connected device running Windows IoT Core with an official Microsoft image.

			* This talk expands on my research into the Equation Group's post exploitation tools. My previous research focused on providing a general overview of DanderSpritz, a full-featured post-exploitation toolkit included in the ShadowBroker's "Lost in Translation" leak. This talk provides a deep dive into KillSuit which is the Equation Group's Swiss Army Knife for persistence, information gathering, defense evasion, and data exfiltration in unique and interesting ways.   During the talk, we will dissect the capabilities and functionality of the KillSuit framework, a little-known (and somewhat overlooked) component of the much larger DanderSpritz post-exploitation toolkit, leaked by the Shadow Brokers in April 2017. KillSuit is a full featured and versatile framework used by a variety of the Equation Group's tools and implants. KillSuit provides the ability to quietly establish persistence on machines via bootkits and other persistence methods and then allows operators to install persistent modules such as keyloggers, packet capture tools, tools that perform WiFi MITM, and other more information gathering tools. KillSuit also includes support for many plugins that provide interesting ways to silently exfiltrate data - some specifically designed to make data exfiltration across air gapped networks possible - including custom written IPSEC-like protocols and misuse of "disabled" WIFI cards and nearby open networks.

					* [Slides](https://github.com/r4wd3r/RID-Hijacking/blob/master/slides/derbycon-8.0/RID_HIJACKING_DERBYCON_2018.pdf)
					* The art of persistence is (and will be...) a matter of concern when successfully exploitation is achieved. Sometimes it is pretty tricky to maintain access on certain environments, especially when it is not possible to execute common vectors like creating or adding users to privileged groups, dumping credentials or hashes, deploying a persistent shell, or anything that could trigger an alert on the victim. This statement ratifies why it's necessary to use discrete and stealthy techniques to keep an open door right after obtaining a high privilege access on the target. What could be more convenient that only use OS resources in order to persist an access? This presentation will provide a new post-exploitation hook applicable to all Windows versions called RID Hijacking, which allows setting desired privileges to an existent account in a stealthy manner by modifying some security attributes. To show its effectiveness, the attack will be demonstrated by using a module which was recently added by Rapid7 to their Metasploit Framework, and developed by the security researcher Sebastián Castro.

If we create a file with the following commands: `$file = "$env:TEMP\test.txt" \ Set-Content -Path $file -Value 'Alternate Data Stream Test File'`. To read the file content, we use the following: `Get-Content -Path $file` ; Which will return: `Alternate Data Stream Test File`
			* [Get-ADS](https://github.com/p0shkatz/Get-ADS)
				* Powershell script to search for alternate data streams This script searches recursively through a specified file system for alternate data streams (ADS). The script can search local and UNC paths speciffied by the $path paramenter. All readable files will have the stream attrubute inspected ignoring the default DATA and FAVICON (image file on URL files) streams. The script use Boe Prox's amazing Get-RunspaceData function and other code to multithread the search. The default number of threads is the number of logical cores plus one. This can be adjusted by specifiying the $threads parameter. Use with caution as runspaces can easily chomp resources (CPU and RAM). Once the number of file system objects (files and folders) is determined, they are split into equal groups of objects divided by the number of threads. Then each thread has a subset of the total objects to inspect for ADS.

			* Have you ever wondered how a boot process works? How a computer detects which operating system it needs to load? Or what is the impact if that single sector in your harddisk is compromised? In this presentation, we are going to look into how Petya, a ransomware, can overwrite an MBR (Master Boot Record), both in MBR- and GPT-style disk, with its malicious code. Then, we are going to follow the code in the MBR and show how a simple malicious kernel code can take control of the boot process until you pay the ransom. I will show a demo on how to debug the MBR to see how the actual native code executes without any API. We are also going to see how we can use a combination of different tools to figure out how a ransomware can infect the very first sector of a harddisk. Tools, such as, Disk Management, DISKPART, WinObj, Process Monitor, and HDHacker. And of course, x64dbg and ollydbg for debugging the ransomware in application-level. And finally, we are going to see how to use Bochs debugger to analyze the malware while it runs its own kernel code.

					* Description: “In this talk we will discuss API Hooking, Process Execution Redirection, Hiding Registry keys and hiding directories on the hard drive. We must be talking about rootkits, right? Well yes, but not in the way you think. The Windows family of operating systems has all of these capabilities built right in! Using nothing but tools and techniques distributed and documented by Microsoft we can implement all of these rootkit functions. During this exciting talk I will present new attacks against Windows operating system that provide rootkit like functionality with built-in OS tools. In session, we’ll demonstrate how to leverage the Microsoft Application Compatibility Toolkit to help hide an attacker’s presence on your system. The Application Compatibility Toolkit allows you to create application shims that intercept and redirect calls from applications to the operating system. This native rootkit like capability is intended to make the Windows operating system compatible with very old or poorly written applications. Do DEP, ASLR, UAC, and Windows Resource Protection, File system ACLS and other modern OS security measures get it your way? No problem. Turn them off! Do you want to hide files and registry keys and from the user? The Application Compatibility toolkit allows you to create a virtual world for any application and hide resources from view. If someone inspects the registry with regedit they will see exactly what the attacker wants them to see and not what the OS sees when it launches programs. Did they patch your target so your exploit doesn’t work? Guess what, making applications backwards compatible is what this tool is intended to do. Make your favorite applications “old exploit compatible” insuring you can re-exploit the target with this awesome untapped resource. Everything you need to subvert windows applications is built right into the windows kernel. Come learn how to use the application compatibility toolkit to tap this great resource.”

First, it was written in 32-bit Delphi (pardon my language) and when it stopped working as everything changed into 64-bit - in (so much simpler when it comes to Win32 API) C, as I did not have 64-bit Delphi. The original implementation was a bit more complex, including broadcasting the changed password over the network etc. but now it works as a demonstration of an idea, so let's keep it as simple as possible. It works everywhere - on local machines for local accounts and on DCs for domain accounts.

Unfortunately, Backdoorme is not a tool to gain root access - only keep that access once it has been gained.

			* Local privilege escalation on Windows is becoming increasingly difficult. Gone are the days when you could just easily exploit the Windows kernel. Multiple controls (KASLR, DEP, SMEP, etc.) have made kernel mode exploitation of the bugs that are discovered much more difficult. In this talk, we'll discuss multiple opportunities for privilege escalation including using COM objects, DLL side loading, and various privileges assigned to user accounts. Bring a Windows 10 VM. We'll have instructions available for recreating the scenarios demonstrated in the talk.

						* I was recently busy doing some reverse on an antivirus solution. During this review, I figured out the Windows 10 Task Scheduler service was looking for a missing DLL exposing it to DLL hijacking/planting. It opens for persistence and privilege escalation in case one can write a rogue DLL in a folder pointed by the PATH environment variable. It can also be used as a UAC bypass.

						* TL;DR .NET Framework can be made to load a profiling DLL or a COM component DLL via user-defined environment variables and CLSID registry entries, even when the process is elevated. This behavior can be exploited to bypass UAC in default settings on Windows 7 to 10 (including the latest RS3 builds) by making an auto-elevate .NET process (such as MMC snap-ins) load an arbitrary DLL.
					* [.NET Profiler DLL Hijack](https://github.com/djhohnstein/.NET-Profiler-DLL-Hijack)
						* The .NET Framework can be coerced into loading a profiling DLL into any .NET assembly when launched. This is done when a handful of environment variables and registry keys are set. For a full write-up you can view this blog here: https://offsec.provadys.com/UAC-bypass-dotnet.html

					* This blog post discusses two vulnerabilities discovered by NCC Group consultants during research undertaken on privilege elevation via COM local services. The first of these vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-1405) is a logic error in a COM service and allows local unprivileged users to execute arbitrary commands as a LOCAL SERVICE user. The second vulnerability (CVE-2019-1322) is a simple service misconfiguration that allows any user in the local SERVICE group to reconfigure a service that executes as SYSTEM (this vulnerability was independently also discovered by other researchers). When combined, these vulnerabilities allow an unprivileged local user to execute arbitrary commands as the SYSTEM user on a default installation of Windows 10.

					* Earlier this week, Microsoft issued patches for CVE-2019-1040, which is a vulnerability that allows for bypassing of NTLM relay mitigations. The vulnerability was discovered by Marina Simakov and Yaron Zinar (as well as several others credited in the Microsoft advisory), and they published a technical write-up about the vulnerability here. The short version is that this vulnerability allows for bypassing of the Message Integrity Code in NTLM authentication. The impact of this however, is quite big if combined with the Printer Bug discovered by Lee Christensen and some of my own research that builds forth on the Kerberos research of Elad Shamir. Using a combination of these vulnerabilities, it is possible to relay SMB authentication to LDAP. This allows for Remote code execution as SYSTEM on any unpatched Windows server or workstation (even those that are in different Active Directory forests), and for instant escalation to Domain Admin via any unpatched Exchange server (unless Exchange permissions were reduced in the domain). The most important takeaway of this post is that you should apply the June 2019 patches as soon as possible.
					* [CVE-2019-1040 scanner](https://github.com/fox-it/cve-2019-1040-scanner)
						* Checks for CVE-2019-1040 vulnerability over SMB. The script will establish a connection to the target host(s) and send an invalid NTLM authentication. If this is accepted, the host is vulnerable to CVE-2019-1040 and you can execute the MIC Remove attack with ntlmrelayx. Note that this does not generate failed login attempts as the login information itself is valid, it is just the NTLM message integrity code that is absent, which is why the authentication is refused without increasing the badpwdcount.

NTLM reflection is still possible through a highly reliable timing attack. The attack works by abusing the logic responsible for its mitigation, a widely speculated challenge cache. Attackers can purge this cache by deliberately failing an authentication attempt and doing so removes all challenge entries older than 5 minutes.

For example as Vincent Yiu pointed out on Twitter if you've got easy access to a system token, say using Metasploit's getsystem command you can impersonate system and then open the TI token, it's just IMO less easy :-). If you get a system token with SeTcbPrivilege you can also call LogonUserExExW or LsaLogonUser where you can specify an set of additional groups to apply to a service token. Finally if you get a system token with SeCreateTokenPrivilege (say from LSASS.exe if it's not running PPL) you can craft an arbitrary token using the NtCreateToken system call.

					* [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/Shakacon/social-engineering-the-windows-kernel-by-james-forshaw)
					* One successful technique in social engineering is pretending to be someone or something you're not and hoping the security guard who's forgotten their reading glasses doesn't look too closely at your fake ID. Of course there's no hyperopic guard in the Windows OS, but we do have an ID card, the Access Token which proves our identity to the system and let's us access secured resources. The Windows kernel provides simple capabilities to identify fake Access Tokens, but sometimes the kernel or other kernel-mode drivers are too busy to use them correctly. If a fake token isn't spotted during a privileged operation local elevation of privilege or information disclosure vulnerabilities can be the result. This could allow an attacker to break out of an application sandbox, elevate to administrator privileges, or even compromise the kernel itself. This presentation is about finding and then exploiting the incorrect handling of tokens in the Windows kernel as well as first and third party drivers. Examples of serious vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2015-0002 and CVE-2015-0062 will be presented. It will provide clear exploitable patterns so that you can do your own security reviews for these issues. Finally, I'll discuss some of the ways of exploiting these types of vulnerabilities to elevate local privileges.

It is required that a privileged user is logged on the same machine (e.g. a Domain Admin user). Once the NTLM type1 is triggered we setup a cross protocol relay server that receive the privileged type1 message and relay it to a third resource by unpacking the RPC protocol and packing the authentication over HTTP. On the receiving end you can setup a further relay node (eg. ntlmrelayx) or relay directly to a privileged resource."

The win32k.sys driver is a major component of the GUI subsystem in the Windows operating system. These vulnerabilities have been reported by the author and patched in MS08-025. The first vulnerability is a kernel pool overflow with an old communication mechanism called the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. The second vulnerability involves improper use of the ProbeForWrite function within string management functions. The third vulnerability concerns how win32k handles system menu functions. Their discovery and exploitation are covered.

			* The shortcomings of anti-virus (AV) solutions have been well known for some time. Nevertheless, both public and private organizations continue to rely on AV software as a critical component of their information security programs, acting as a key protection mechanism over endpoints and other information systems within their networks. As a result, the security posture of these organizations is significantly jeopardized by relying only on this weakened control.

During this talk, Kyle and Chris expose several semi-public and private techniques used to evade the most common persistence enumeration tools. Their techniques will explore ways to re-invent the run key, unconventionally abuse search order, and exploit trusted applications. To complement their technical explanations, each bypass includes a live demo and recommendations for detection.

We'll discuss the basics of the AV evasion problem, what techniques work, which ones don't and why. The talk will have a particular focus on AV evasion as it relates to Metasploit payloads.

				* Description: Think of the last time you got sick. Your immune system is an amazing piece of machinery, but every now and then, something gets past it. Antivirus evasion techniques can become more effective when modeled after infectious diseases. This talk highlights many of the antivirus evasion techniques in use today. Going further, this talk shows how genetic algorithms can quickly and repeatedly “evolve” code to evade many malicious code detection techniques in use today.

				* The job of a penetration tester is to emulate real-world, realistic adversaries to compromise the client and explain the business risks of the technical findings. Those pesky real-world adversaries bypass AV all the time, even with essentially the same malware, over and over.  How do they do it? Simple. By understanding what traps AV is setting, you can step around, jump over, or disable those traps before sauntering to your destination unhindered. I can't help with your saunter, but I can help you understand and bypass AV using arbitrary payloads (whether Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Covenant, Mystic, SILENTTRINITY, or whichever) in many ways, all in less than an hour.

				* In Windows 10, Microsoft introduced the AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI) which is designed to target script-based attacks and malware. Script-based attacks have been lethal for enterprise security and with advent of PowerShell, such attacks have become increasingly common. AMSI targets malicious scripts written in PowerShell, VBScript, JScript etc. and drastically improves detection and blocking rate of malicious scripts. When a piece of code is submitted for execution to the scripting host, AMSI steps in and the code is scanned for malicious content. What makes AMSI effective is, no matter how obfuscated the code is, it needs to be presented to the script host in clear text and unobfuscated. Moreover, since the code is submitted to AMSI just before execution, it doesn't matter if the code came from disk, memory or was entered interactively. AMSI is an open interface and MS says any application will be able to call its APIs. Currently, Windows Defender uses it on Windows 10. Has Microsoft finally killed script-based attacks? What are the ways out? The talk will be full of live demonstrations.

				* A deep dive into file formats used in MS Office and how we can leverage these for offensive purposes. We will show how to fully weaponize ‘p-code’ across all MS Office versions in order to create malicious documents without using VBA code, successfully bypassing antivirus and other defensive measures. In this talk Stan and Pieter will do a deep dive into the file formats used in MS Office, demonstrating many features that can be used offensively. They will present attacks that apply to both the legacy formats (OLE streams) and the newer XML based documents. Specific focus is around the internal representation of VBA macros and pseudo code (p-code, execodes) and how these can be weaponized. We will detail the inner logic of Word and Excel regarding VBA and p-code, and release scripts and tools for creating malicious Office documents that bypass anti-virus, YARA rules, AMSI for VBA and various MS Office document analyzers.

					* “The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world. Lies will pass into history.” George Orwell. Objective truth is essential for security. Logs, notifications and saved data must reflect the actual events for security tools, forensic teams and IT managers to perform their job correctly. Powershell is a prime example of the constant cat and mouse game hackers and security personnel play every day to either reveal or hide the “objective truth” of a running script. Powershell’s auto logging, obfuscation techniques, AMSI and more are all participants of the same game playing by the same rules. We don’t like rules, so we broke them. As a result, Babel-Shellfish and Invisi-Shelltwo new tools that both expose and disguise powershell scripts were born. Babel-Shellfish reveals the inner hidden code of any obfuscated script while Invisi-Shell offers a new method of hiding malicious scripts, even from the Powershell process running it. Join us as we present a new way to think about scripts.

The security market is focusing on open source data collection sources and security researchers as the main method to write signatures to detect attacks, much like what we saw in the 90s with traditional anti-virus tech. Not much has changed, let’s dive into the reality in security and how little these protective measures really do in the grand scheme of things. We’ll also be covering solid practices in defending against attacks, and what we should be focusing on.

				* While security products are a great supplement to the defensive posture of an enterprise, to well-funded nation-state actors, they are an impediment to achieving their objectives. As pentesters argue the efficacy of a product because it doesn't detect their specific offensive technique, mature actors recognize a need to holistically subvert the product at every step during the course their operation.

				* In this project, we study the behavioural detection engines of the antivirus in both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7 by using specialised modules to identify the technologies that the antivirus are using to monitor application behaviours. Our analysis revealed that the 64-bit versions of the antivirus are generally weaker than their 32-bit versions. To determine the effectiveness of the antivirus behavioural detection engines, we propose replaying the actions of applications from sandbox logs to the antivirus and observing the reaction of the antivirus. Our experiments demonstrated that this approach can illustrate the capabilities of the antivirus behavioural detection engines and uncover the behavioural detection signatures of the antivirus at the same time.

				* With the continuous rise of malicious campaigns and the exploitation of new attack vectors, it is necessary to assess the efficacy of the defensive mechanisms used to detect them. To this end, the contribution of our work is twofold. First, it introduces a new method for obfuscating malicious code to bypass all static checks of multi-engine scanners, such as VirusTotal. Interestingly, our approach to generating the malicious executables is not based on introducing a new packer but on the augmentation of the capabilities of an existing and widely used tool for packaging Python, PyInstaller but can be used for all similar packaging tools. As we prove, the problem is deeper and inherent in almost all antivirus engines and not PyInstaller specific. Second, our work exposes significant issues of well-known sandboxes that allow malware to evade their checks. As a result, we show that stealth and evasive malware can be efficiently developed, bypassing with ease state of the art malware detection tools without raising any alert.

					* How to bypass all Microsoft latest "Attack Surface Reduction" rules with malicious Office documents and scripts. The last years, I have been doing some research around Windows security. I liked exploring APT/Redteam techniques and payload used for social engineering and airgap bypass attacks. I am naturally interested into new security features such as ASR. Microsoft introduced Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) as part of Windows defender exploit guard. ASR is composed of a set of configurable rules such as: "Block Office applications from creating child process". While these rules seem effective against common Office and scripts malwares, there are ways to bypass all of them. We will go over each rule related to malicious Office or VB scripts behavior, analyze how It work behind the scene and find a way to bypass it. As example we will take common attack scenario and see how they can be achieved with all rules enforced: Download execute DLL/EXE/script from Office/VBscript; Drop execute embedded DLL/EXE/script from Office/VBscript; Machine takeover with Meterpreter shell from Office/VBscript; Lateral movement/UAC bypass/AMSI bypass/etc.

				* This post is about resuming the very inspiring Rui’s piece on Windows Kernel’s callbacks and taking it a little further by extending new functionalities and build an all-purpose AV/EDR runtime detection bypass. Specifically, we are going to see how Kaspersky Total Security and Windows Defender are using kernel callbacks to either inhibit us from accessing LSASS loaded module or detect malicious activities. We’ll then use our evil driver to temporarily silence any registered AV’s callbacks and restore EDR original code once we are done with our task. The resulting tool has been tested on the following Windows 10 builds: 1903,1909 and 2004.

				* [Paper](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2011/BH_US_11_Mandt_win32k_WP.pdf)
				* "15 years ago, Windows NT 4.0 introduced Win32k.sys to address the inherent limitations of the older client-server graphics subsystem model. Today, win32k still remains a fundamental component of the Windows architecture and manages both the Window Manager (User) and Graphics Device Interface (GDI). In order to properly interface with user-mode data, win32k makes use of user-mode callbacks, a mechanism allowing the kernel to make calls back into user-mode. Usermode callbacks enable a variety of tasks such as invoking applicationdefined hooks, providing event notifications, and copying data to/from user-mode. In this paper, we discuss the many challenges and problems concerning user-mode callbacks in win32k. In particular, we show how win32k’s dependency on global locks in providing a thread-safe environment does not integrate well with the concept of user-mode callbacks. Although many vulnerabilities related to user-mode callbacks have been addressed, their complex nature suggests that more subtle flaws might still be present in win32k. Thus, in an effort to mitigate some of the more prevalent bug classes, we conclusively provide some suggestions as to how users may protect themselves against future kernel attacks."

				* [Slides](https://github.com/yardenshafir/CallbackObjectAnalyzer/tree/main/Slides)
				* [CallbackObjectAnalyzer](https://github.com/yardenshafir/CallbackObjectAnalyzer)
				* Whether you’re an attacker, trying to persist and gather information while avoiding detection, or a defender, trying to monitor everything that’s running on a box and staying a step ahead of the attackers, everyone wants to know what’s happening on a machine. Windows has a mechanism that can fulfill all these needs and isn’t getting the attention it deserves – callback objects.  Used by many kernel components and easy to access for 3rd-party drivers, these objects can supply valuable information about various kernel events, internal AV communication, and more.  Even Patch Guard has its own callback!  As helpful as they are, they are mostly ignored by security solutions, making them a great place for rootkits to hide in, where no one is looking.

				* [Code](https://github.com/Anonymous-3ab41c/FastAndFurious)
				* Modern Operating Systems (OSs) enable user processes to obtain full access control over other processes initiated by the same user. In scenarios of sensitive security processes (e.g., antivirus software), protection schemes are enforced at the kernel level such as to confront arbitrary user processes overtaking with malicious intent. Within the Windows family of OSs, the kernel driver is notified via dedicated routines for user-mode processes that require protection. In such cases the kernel driver establishes a callback mechanism triggered whenever a handle request for the original user-mode process is initiated by a different user process. Subsequently, the kernel driver performs a selective permission removal process (e.g., read access to the process memory) prior to passing a handle to the requesting process. In this paper we are the first to demonstrate a fundamental user-mode process access control vulnerability, existing in Windows 7 up to the most recent Windows 10 OSs. We show that a user-mode process can indeed obtain a fully privileged access handle before the kernel driver is notified, thus prior to the callback mechanism establishment. Our study shows that this flaw can be exploited by a method to (i) disable the anti-malware suite Symantec Endpoint Protection; (ii) overtake VirtualBox protected processes; (iii) circumvent two major video game anti-cheat protection solutions, BattlEye and EasyAntiCheat. Finally we provide recommendations on how to address the discovered vulnerability.

This code checks for popular EDR/AV driver names and removes them from `PspSetXXXXNotifyRoutine` callback array. To do so the code checks for a byte pattern that occurs before `jmp PspSetXXXXNotifyRoutine` instructions. The byte pattern differs among windows versions, so this code aims to cover all of them.

					* With Microsoft continuously improving kernel mitigations and raising the exploitation bar for native kernel components, third-party kernel drivers are becoming a more appealing target for real attackers and security researchers. A vulnerability in a signed third-party driver can have a dramatic impact as it can be abused by attackers to escalate their privileges, without the complexity of a kernel zero-day. Computer manufacturers usually ship devices with software and tools to facilitate device management. This software often contains components running with ring-0 privileges in kernel. With these components installed by default, they must be as secure as the kernel, otherwise they can become the Achilles Heel for the whole kernel security design. In this session, we’ll explain exactly how we discovered such a driver. From an anomalous behavior alerted by a kernel sensor of Windows Defender ATP, we dug deeper into a specific device management driver, where we found a highly obscure design. This led us to the discovery of a zero-day vulnerability, which resulted in a local privilege escalation that affected millions of devices.

					* [ExploitCapcom](https://github.com/tandasat/ExploitCapcom)
						* This is a standalone exploit for a vulnerable feature in Capcom.sys. The feature is exposed through IOCTL and to execute an arbitrary user supplied function pointer with disabling SMEP. This exploit simply abuses the feature to perform token stealing to get the SYSTEM privileges, and then launches the command prompt with the elevated privilege.
					* [Reflective-Driver-Loader](https://github.com/Professor-plum/Reflective-Driver-Loader)
						* Reflective Kernel Driver injection is a injection technique base off Reflective DLL injection by Stephen Fewer. The technique bypasses Windows driver signing enforcement (KMCS). Reflective programming is employed to perform the loading of a driver from memory into the kernel. As such the driver is responsible for loading itself by implementing a minimal Portable Executable (PE) file loader. Injection works on Windows Vista up to Windows 10, running on x64.
					* [IRPMon](https://github.com/MartinDrab/IRPMon)
						* The goal of the tool is to monitor requests received by selected device objects or kernel drivers. The tool is quite similar to IrpTracker but has several enhancements. It supports 64-bit versions of Windows (no inline hooks are used, only modifications to driver object structures are performed) and monitors IRP, FastIo, AddDevice, DriverUnload and StartIo requests.

The driver hooks various Nt* kernel functions (using SSDT table hooks) and modifies the return values of the original functions. To hide a process, you must pass a simple structure with a ProcessID and the hiding option(s) to enable, to the driver. The internal API is designed to add hooks with little effort, which means adding features is really easy.

				* For those who don’t know, WdFilter is the main kernel component of Windows Defender. Roughly, this Driver works as a Minifilter from the load order group “FSFilter Anti-Virus”, this means that is attached to the File System stack (Actually, quite high - Big Altitude) and handles I/O operations in some Pre/Post callbacks. Not only that, this driver also implements other techniques to get information of what’s going on in the system. The goal of this series of post is to have a solid understanding on how this works under the hood.

				* This paper discusses the theoretical and practical implementations of kernel-mode payloads on Windows. At the time of this writing, kernel-mode research is generally regarded as the realm of a few, but it is hoped that documents such as this one will encourage a thoughtful progression of the subject matter. To that point, this paper will describe some of the general techniques and algorithms that may be useful when implementing kernel-mode payloads. Furthermore, the anatomy of a kernel-mode payload will be broken down into four distinct units, known as payload components, and explained in detail. In the end, the reader should walk away with a concrete understanding of the way in which kernel-mode payloads operate on Windows.

				* A funny thing happened when I evaluated several EDR, ETDR and Next Gen AV products, currently all the rage and latest must have security solution. Surprisingly to me the solutions kinda sucked at things we expected them to do or be better at, thus this talk so you can learn from our efforts. While testing, flaws were discovered and shared with the vendors, some of the flaws, bugs, or vulns that were discovered will be discussed. This talk takes a look at what we initially expected the solutions to provide us, the options or categories of what these solutions address, what to consider when doing an evaluation, how to go about testing these solutions, how they would fit into our process, and what we found while testing these solutions. What enraged me about these EDR solutions were how they were all over the place in how they worked, how hard or ease of use of the solutions, and the fact I found malware that did not trigger an alert on every solution I tested. And this is the next new bright and shiny blinky security savior solution? The news is not all bad, there is hope if you do some work to understand what these solutions target and provide, what to look for, and most importantly how to test them! What we never anticipated or expected is the tool we used to compare the tests and how well it worked and how it can help you.

				* [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/JasonLang1/modern-evasion-techniques)
				* As pentesters, we are often in need of working around security controls. In this talk, we will reveal ways that we bypass in-line network defenses, spam filters (in line and cloud based), as well as current endpoint solutions. Some techniques are old, some are new, but all work in helping to get a foothold established. Defenders: might want to come to this one.

				* Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product vendors will give you the spiel on what they do and their capabilities, but how do they actually work at the lowest level? And how can we discover weaknesses in these products to develop bypasses or evaluate them?  Christopher will reverse engineer an EDR product and the windows kernel to unveil its inner-workings, alongside the windows kernel structures and functions EDR products rely on to operate, and by doing so discover weaknesses and gaps in their protections that allow actors to bypass the product’s defenses, rendering them null & void. Finally, by abusing an identified weakness, he’ll use a custom-built mimikatz to dump all the hashes on a machine protected by EDR.

				* [Slides](http://i.blackhat.com/eu-19/Thursday/eu-19-Noguera-Unveiling-The-Underground-World-Of-Anti-Cheats-2.pdf)
				* During our research, we analyzed, tested and discovered multiple bypassing techniques against different current market Anti-Cheat technologies such as XignCode3, EasyAntiCheat and BattleEye, to understand and determine the current state of the art of Anti-Cheat software. We use a combination of static and dynamic techniques to document the different techniques to protect and unprotect gaming software. As a result, we put together a tool "AntiCheat-Testing-Framework" that contains a series of bypassing techniques to test them against current market Anti-Cheats software, this will allow attendees and researchers to understand the virtues and weaknesses of them.  This talk pretends to catch everyone's attention from new people to experts on the field, starting with a state of the market and interesting cases around the cheating world, and finishing with a deep explanation of each analyzed technique and the results we obtained during the journey.
			* [Tricking modern endpoint security products - Michel Coene(SANS2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmNpS9mbwEc)
				* The current endpoint monitoring capabilities we have available to us are unprecedented. Many tools and our self/community-built detection rules rely on parent-child relationships and command-line arguments to detect malicious activity taking place on a system. There are, however, ways the adversaries can get around these detections. During this presentation, we'll talk about the following techniques and how we can detect them: Parent-child relationships spoofing; Command-line arguments spoofing; Process injection; Process hollowing

Dynamic invocation (also known as D/Invoke) – a sub branch of the popular “Sharpsploit” project, can help with evading those pesky EDR’s and execute your payloads successfully. In this presentation, we will go over D/Invokes capabilities and how to leverage them in your red team operations.

				*  Advanced persistent threats pose a significant challenge for blue teams as they apply various attacks over prolonged periods, impeding event correlation and their detection. In this work, we leverage various diverse attack scenarios to assess the efficacy of EDRs against detecting and preventing APTs. Our results indicate that there is still a lot of room for improvement as state-of-the-art EDRs fail to prevent and log the bulk of the attacks that are reported in this work. Additionally, we discuss methods to tamper with the telemetry providers of EDRs, allowing an adversary to perform a more stealth attack.

				* "We’ll start by examining the issues that ALL EDRs face in their current deployment and how hackers can take advantage of this to completely bypass the product and blind them to their malicious activities. We will look from the perspective of EDRs as a whole; most of these flaws are present in all of them. Once we understand the systemic issues and how attackers can abuse them, we’ll focus on several techniques developed and deployed in the wild that are highly successful. We’ll conclude with some new techniques that will be introduced into ScareCrow 2.0 being released after the talk."

Combining an analysis of the feature extraction process, its heavy reliance on strings, and its strong bias for this specific game, we are capable of crafting a simple and rather amusing bypass. Namely, by appending a selected list of strings to a malicious file, we are capable of changing its score significantly, avoiding detection. This method proved successful for 100% of the top 10 Malware for May 2019, and close to 90% for a larger sample of 384 malware."

				* Microsoft's User Account Control feature, introduced in Windows Vista, has been a topic of interest to many in the security community. Since UAC was designed to force user approval for administrative actions, attackers (and red teamers) encounter UAC on nearly every engagement. As a result, bypassing this control is a task that an actor often has to overcome, despite its lack of formal designation as a security boundary. This talk highlights what UAC is, previous work by others, research methodology, and details several technical UAC bypasses developed by the author.

				* User Account Control (UAC) is a mechanism implemented in Windows systems from Vista to prevent malicious software from executing with administrative privileges without user consent. However, this mechanism does not provide a secure solution to that problem, since can be easily bypassed in some ways, something we will show by means of different methods such as DLL hijacking, token impersonation or COM interface elevation, also we will show a new method which we have developed based on a previous one. Moreover, this new Proof of Concept has been ported to the Metasploit Framework as a new module, which indeed is the only UAC bypass module that works in the latest Windows 10 build version.

				* This exploit abuses the way "WinSxS" is managed by "dccw.exe" by means of a derivative Leo's Davidson "Bypass UAC" method so as to obtain an administrator shell without prompting for consent. It supports "x86" and "x64" architectures. Moreover, it has been successfully tested on Windows 8.1 9600, Windows 10 14393, Windows 10 15031 and Windows 10 15062.
			* [Bypass-UAC](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite/tree/master/Bypass-UAC)
				* Bypass-UAC provides a framework to perform UAC bypasses based on auto elevating IFileOperation COM object method calls. This is not a new technique, traditionally, this is accomplished by injecting a DLL into "explorer.exe". This is not desirable because injecting into explorer may trigger security alerts and working with unmanaged DLL's makes for an inflexible work-flow. To get around this, Bypass-UAC implements a function which rewrites PowerShell's PEB to give it the appearance of "explorer.exe". This provides the same effect because COM objects exclusively rely on Windows's Process Status API (PSAPI) which reads the process PEB.

					* Skilled attackers continually seek out new attack vectors and effective ways of obfuscating old techniques to evade detection. Active defenders can attest to attackers’ prolific obfuscation of JavaScript, VBScript and PowerShell payloads given the ample availability of obfuscation frameworks and their effectiveness at evading many of today’s defenses. However, advanced defenders are increasingly detecting this obfuscation with help from the data science community. This approach paired with deeper visibility into memory-resident payloads via interfaces like Microsoft’s Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is causing some Red Teamers to shift tradecraft to languages that offer defenders less visibility. But what are attackers using in the wild? In the past year numerous APT and FIN (Financial) threat actors have increasingly introduced obfuscation techniques into their usage of native Windows binaries like wscript.exe, regsvr32.exe and cmd.exe. Some simple approaches entail randomly adding cmd.exe’s caret (^) escape character to command arguments. More interesting techniques like those employed by APT32, FIN7 and FIN8 involve quotes, parentheses and standard input.The most interesting obfuscation technique observed in the wild was FIN7’s use of cmd.exe’s string replacement functionality identified in June 2017. This discovery single-handedly initiated my research into cmd.exe’s surprisingly effective but vastly unexplored obfuscation capabilities. In this presentation I will dive deep into cmd.exe’s multi-faceted obfuscation opportunities beginning with carets, quotes and stdin argument hiding. Next I will extrapolate more complex techniques including FIN7’s string removal/replacement concept and two never-before-seen obfuscation and full encoding techniques - all performed entirely in memory by cmd.exe. Finally, I will outline three approaches for obfuscating binary names from static and dynamic analysis while highlighting lesser-known cmd.exe replacement binaries. I will conclude this talk by giving a live demo of my cmd.exe obfuscation framework called Invoke-DOSfuscation that obfuscates payloads using these multi-layered techniques. I will also share detection implications and approaches for this genre of obfuscation.

				* In this article I am going to describe a way to execute code in windows kernel by using windbg local kernel debugging. It’s not a vulnerability, I am going to use only windbg’s legal functionality, and I am going to use only a batch file (not powershell, or vbs, an old style batch only) and some Microsoft’s signed executables (some of them that are already in the system and windbg, that we will be dumped from the batch file). With this method it is not necessary to launch executables at user mode (only Microsoft signed executables) or load signed drivers. PatchGuard and other protections don’t stop us. We put our code directly into kernel memory space and we hook some point to get a thread executing it. As we will demonstrate, a malware consisting of a simple batch file would be able to jump to kernel, enabling local kernel debugging and using windbg to get its code being executed in kernel.

					* [Knockin’ on Heaven’s Gate – Dynamic Processor Mode Switching - George Nicolaou(2012)](http://rce.co/knockin-on-heavens-gate-dynamic-processor-mode-switching/)
						* This post presents the research conducted under the domain of dynamic processor mode (or context) switching that takes place prior to the invocation of kernel mode functions in 32bit processes running under a 64bit Windows kernel. Processes that are designed and compiled to execute under a 32bit environment get loaded inside the Windows-on-Windows64 ( WoW64 ) subsystem and are assigned threads running in IA-32e compatibility mode ( 32bit mode ). When a kernel request is being made through the standard WoW64 libraries, at some point, the thread switches to 64bit mode, the request is executed, the thread switches back to compatibility mode and execution is passed back to the caller.  The switch from 32bit compatibility mode to 64bit mode is made through a specific segment call gate referred to as the Heaven’s Gate, thus the title of this topic. All threads executing under the WoW64 environment can execute a FAR CALL through this segment gate and switch to the 64bit mode.  The feature of mode switch can also be viewed from the security and maliciousness point of view. It can be used as an anti reverse engineering technique for protecting software up to the malicious ( or not ) intends of cross process generic library injection or antivirus and sandbox evasion. The result of this research is a library named W64oWoW64 which stands for Windows64 On Windows On Windows64.

Since its appearance more than five years ago, it has been – and remains – the most notorious and costly active malware. Emotet owes its reputation to its constant state of evolution and change. The malware’s rapid advancement helps support its highly sophisticated operation. This paper will discuss the reverse engineering of its components, as well as the capabilities and features of Emotet: a detailed overview of its multi-layered operation, starting with the spam lure, the malicious attachments (and their evolution), and the malware executable itself, from its highly sophisticated packer to its C2 server communications.

				* Imagine being attacked by legitimate software tools that cannot be detected by usual defender tools. How bad could it be to be attacked by malicious threat actors only sending bytes to be read and bytes to be written in order to achieve advanced attacks? The most dangerous threat is the one you can’t see. At a time when it is not obvious to detect memory attacks using API like VirtualAlloc, what would be worse than having to detect something like `f0xffffe0010c79ebe8+0x8 L4 0xe8 0xcb 0x04 0x10`? We will be able to demonstrate that we can achieve every kind of attacks you can imagine using only PowerShell and a Microsoft Signed Debugger. We can retrieve passwords from the userland memory, execute shellcode by dynamically parsing loaded PE or attack the kernel achieving advanced persistence inside any system.

				* Microsoft's User Account Control feature, introduced in Windows Vista, has been a topic of interest to many in the security community. Since UAC was designed to force user approval for administrative actions, attackers (and red teamers) encounter UAC on nearly every engagement. As a result, bypassing this control is a task that an actor often has to overcome, despite its lack of formal designation as a security boundary. This talk highlights what UAC is, previous work by others, research methodology, and details several technical UAC bypasses developed by the author.

				* User Account Control (UAC) is a mechanism implemented in Windows systems from Vista to prevent malicious software from executing with administrative privileges without user consent. However, this mechanism does not provide a secure solution to that problem, since can be easily bypassed in some ways, something we will show by means of different methods such as DLL hijacking, token impersonation or COM interface elevation, also we will show a new method which we have developed based on a previous one. Moreover, this new Proof of Concept has been ported to the Metasploit Framework as a new module, which indeed is the only UAC bypass module that works in the latest Windows 10 build version.

				* This exploit abuses the way "WinSxS" is managed by "dccw.exe" by means of a derivative Leo's Davidson "Bypass UAC" method so as to obtain an administrator shell without prompting for consent. It supports "x86" and "x64" architectures. Moreover, it has been successfully tested on Windows 8.1 9600, Windows 10 14393, Windows 10 15031 and Windows 10 15062.
			* [Bypass-UAC](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite/tree/master/Bypass-UAC)
				* Bypass-UAC provides a framework to perform UAC bypasses based on auto elevating IFileOperation COM object method calls. This is not a new technique, traditionally, this is accomplished by injecting a DLL into "explorer.exe". This is not desirable because injecting into explorer may trigger security alerts and working with unmanaged DLL's makes for an inflexible work-flow. To get around this, Bypass-UAC implements a function which rewrites PowerShell's PEB to give it the appearance of "explorer.exe". This provides the same effect because COM objects exclusively rely on Windows's Process Status API (PSAPI) which reads the process PEB.

					* Skilled attackers continually seek out new attack vectors and effective ways of obfuscating old techniques to evade detection. Active defenders can attest to attackers’ prolific obfuscation of JavaScript, VBScript and PowerShell payloads given the ample availability of obfuscation frameworks and their effectiveness at evading many of today’s defenses. However, advanced defenders are increasingly detecting this obfuscation with help from the data science community. This approach paired with deeper visibility into memory-resident payloads via interfaces like Microsoft’s Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is causing some Red Teamers to shift tradecraft to languages that offer defenders less visibility. But what are attackers using in the wild? In the past year numerous APT and FIN (Financial) threat actors have increasingly introduced obfuscation techniques into their usage of native Windows binaries like wscript.exe, regsvr32.exe and cmd.exe. Some simple approaches entail randomly adding cmd.exe’s caret (^) escape character to command arguments. More interesting techniques like those employed by APT32, FIN7 and FIN8 involve quotes, parentheses and standard input.The most interesting obfuscation technique observed in the wild was FIN7’s use of cmd.exe’s string replacement functionality identified in June 2017. This discovery single-handedly initiated my research into cmd.exe’s surprisingly effective but vastly unexplored obfuscation capabilities. In this presentation I will dive deep into cmd.exe’s multi-faceted obfuscation opportunities beginning with carets, quotes and stdin argument hiding. Next I will extrapolate more complex techniques including FIN7’s string removal/replacement concept and two never-before-seen obfuscation and full encoding techniques - all performed entirely in memory by cmd.exe. Finally, I will outline three approaches for obfuscating binary names from static and dynamic analysis while highlighting lesser-known cmd.exe replacement binaries. I will conclude this talk by giving a live demo of my cmd.exe obfuscation framework called Invoke-DOSfuscation that obfuscates payloads using these multi-layered techniques. I will also share detection implications and approaches for this genre of obfuscation.

				* In this article I am going to describe a way to execute code in windows kernel by using windbg local kernel debugging. It’s not a vulnerability, I am going to use only windbg’s legal functionality, and I am going to use only a batch file (not powershell, or vbs, an old style batch only) and some Microsoft’s signed executables (some of them that are already in the system and windbg, that we will be dumped from the batch file). With this method it is not necessary to launch executables at user mode (only Microsoft signed executables) or load signed drivers. PatchGuard and other protections don’t stop us. We put our code directly into kernel memory space and we hook some point to get a thread executing it. As we will demonstrate, a malware consisting of a simple batch file would be able to jump to kernel, enabling local kernel debugging and using windbg to get its code being executed in kernel.

					* [Knockin’ on Heaven’s Gate – Dynamic Processor Mode Switching - George Nicolaou(2012)](http://rce.co/knockin-on-heavens-gate-dynamic-processor-mode-switching/)
						* This post presents the research conducted under the domain of dynamic processor mode (or context) switching that takes place prior to the invocation of kernel mode functions in 32bit processes running under a 64bit Windows kernel. Processes that are designed and compiled to execute under a 32bit environment get loaded inside the Windows-on-Windows64 ( WoW64 ) subsystem and are assigned threads running in IA-32e compatibility mode ( 32bit mode ). When a kernel request is being made through the standard WoW64 libraries, at some point, the thread switches to 64bit mode, the request is executed, the thread switches back to compatibility mode and execution is passed back to the caller.  The switch from 32bit compatibility mode to 64bit mode is made through a specific segment call gate referred to as the Heaven’s Gate, thus the title of this topic. All threads executing under the WoW64 environment can execute a FAR CALL through this segment gate and switch to the 64bit mode.  The feature of mode switch can also be viewed from the security and maliciousness point of view. It can be used as an anti reverse engineering technique for protecting software up to the malicious ( or not ) intends of cross process generic library injection or antivirus and sandbox evasion. The result of this research is a library named W64oWoW64 which stands for Windows64 On Windows On Windows64.

						* Based on Sophos detection numbers, the Emotet trojan is the most widespread malware family in the wild. Since its appearance more than five years ago, it has been – and remains – the most notorious and costly active malware. Emotet owes its reputation to its constant state of evolution and change. The malware’s rapid advancement helps support its highly sophisticated operation. This paper will discuss the reverse engineering of its components, as well as the capabilities and features of Emotet: a detailed overview of its multi-layered operation, starting with the spam lure, the malicious attachments (and their evolution), and the malware executable itself, from its highly sophisticated packer to its C2 server communications.

				* Imagine being attacked by legitimate software tools that cannot be detected by usual defender tools. How bad could it be to be attacked by malicious threat actors only sending bytes to be read and bytes to be written in order to achieve advanced attacks? The most dangerous threat is the one you can’t see. At a time when it is not obvious to detect memory attacks using API like VirtualAlloc, what would be worse than having to detect something like `f0xffffe0010c79ebe8+0x8 L4 0xe8 0xcb 0x04 0x10`? We will be able to demonstrate that we can achieve every kind of attacks you can imagine using only PowerShell and a Microsoft Signed Debugger. We can retrieve passwords from the userland memory, execute shellcode by dynamically parsing loaded PE or attack the kernel achieving advanced persistence inside any system.

				* Password managers allow the storage and retrieval of sensitive information from an encrypted database. Users rely on them to provide better security guarantees against trivial exfiltration than alternative ways of storing passwords, such as an unsecured flat text file. In this paper we propose security guarantees password managers should offer and examine the underlying workings of five popular password managers targeting the Windows 10 platform: 1Password 7, 1Password 4, Dashlane, KeePass, and LastPass. We anticipated that password managers would employ basic security best practices, such as scrubbing secrets from memory when they are not in use and sanitization of memory once a password manager was logged out and placed into a locked state. However, we found that in all password managers we examined, trivial secrets extraction was possible from a locked password manager, including the master password in some cases, exposing up to 60 million users that use the password managers in this study to secrets retrieval from an assumed secure locked state.

A snapshot is a shadow copy—created by the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)—of the volumes that contain the Active Directory database and log files.

				* In this article, we have demonstrated that in some scenarios, the default Windows configuration leads to the SHA‑1 hash of the user’s password being stored to the disk in a way that is retrievable without any further knowledge about the password. We argue that this is an issue for DPAPI, because if the secret necessary for decrypting the master key was to be stored on the disk by design, Microsoft could have kept on using the NTLM hash it uses in domain settings (and supposedly used in the first implementation of DPAPI). We then demonstrated how this attack can be executed using readily available tools.

This tool connects to ESE (Extensible Storage Engine) and reads tables/records including hidden objects by low level C API. The tool can extract ntds.dit file without stopping lsass.exe. When Active Directory Service is running, lsass.exe locks the file and does not allow to access to it. The snapshot wizard copies ntds.dit using VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) even if the file is exclusively locked. As copying ntds.dit may cause data inconsistency in ESE DB, the wizard automatically runs esentutil /repair command to fix the inconsistency.

Another example is the method it invokes to get the current process PID for the $pid variable. Any .NET application that uses the System.Diagnostics.Process class also enables this privilege.

			* [You Can Type, but You Can’t Hide: A Stealthy GPU-based Keylogger](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mikepo/papers/gpukeylogger.eurosec13.pdf) 
				* Keyloggers are a prominent class of malware that harvests sensitive data by recording any typed in information. Key- logger implementations strive to hide their presence using rootkit-like techniques to evade detection by antivirus and other system protections. In this paper, we present a new approach for implementing a stealthy keylogger: we explore the possibility of leveraging the graphics card as an alterna- tive environment for hosting the operation of a keylogger. The key idea behind our approach is to monitor the system’s keyboard buffer directly from the GPU via DMA, without any hooks or modifications in the kernel’s code and data structures besides the page table. The evaluation of our pro- totype implementation shows that a GPU-based keylogger can effectively record all user keystrokes, store them in the memory space of the GPU, and even analyze the recorded data in-place, with negligible runtime overhead.

However, this will not cause a failed logon to appear in the Windows® event log. It will also not increment the count of failed logon attempts for the service account. Therefore, the result is an ability to perform brute-force (or, more realistically, dictionary-based) password checks for such a service account, without locking it out or generating suspicious event log entries.

					* Last month Bleeping Computer published an article about PKTMON.EXE, a little known utility in Windows 10 that provides the ability to sniff and monitor network traffic.  I quickly wondered if it would be feasible to use this utility, and other native tools within Windows, to capture NTLMv2 network authentication handshakes. TL;DR: Yes it is possible and I wrote a Python3 script called NTLMRawUnHide that can extract NTLMv2 password hashes from packet dumps of many formats!

The original implementation was a bit more complex, including broadcasting the changed password over the network etc. but now it works as a demonstration of an idea, so let's keep it as simple as possible. It works everywhere - on local machines for local accounts and on DCs for domain accounts."

This saves you from trying your hashes against other accounts live, which triggers lockouts and alerts.

			* [Spray](https://github.com/Greenwolf/Spray)
				* A Password Spraying tool for Active Directory Credentials by Jacob Wilkin(Greenwolf)
			* [Sharphose](https://github.com/ustayready/SharpHose)
				* SharpHose is a C# password spraying tool designed to be fast, safe, and usable over Cobalt Strike's execute-assembly. It provides a flexible way to interact with Active Directory using domain-joined and non-joined contexts, while also being able to target specific domains and domain controllers. SharpHose takes into consideration the domain password policy, including fine grained password policies, in an attempt to avoid account lockouts. Fine grained password policies are enumerated for the users and groups that that the policy applies to. If the policy applied also to groups, the group users are captured. All enabled domain users are then classified according to their password policies, in order of precedence, and marked as safe or unsafe. The remaining users are filtered against an optional user-supplied exclude list. Besides just spraying, red team operators can view all of the password policies for a domain, all the users affected by the policy, or just view the enabled domain users. Output can be sent directly to the console or to a user-supplied output folder.

But what if the chewy inside is bitchy and challenges you everywhere you want to go? That's what P3KI is all about: To make the chewy inside more bitchy. Hear about how we intend to make your life harder and why the often dismissed "social engineering" aspect might become essential in cases where you face a network employing P3KI's technology deployed.

				* Attackers have used the Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack for over two decades. Its effectiveness has led to several changes to the design of Windows. Those changes influenced the feasibility of the attack and the effectiveness of the tools used to execute it. At the same time, novel PtH attack strategies appeared. All this has led to confusion about what is still feasible and what configurations of Windows are vulnerable. This paper examines various methods of hash extraction and execution of the PtH attack. It identifies the prerequisites for the attack and suggests hardening options. Testing in Windows 10 v1903 supports the findings. Ultimately, this paper shows the level of risk posed by PtH to environments using the latest version of Windows 10.
			* [Et tu Kerberos - Christopher Campbell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIRQQCM4wz8)
				* For over a decade we have been told that Kerberos is the answer to Microsoft’s authentication woes and now we know that isn’t the case. The problems with LM and NTLM are widely known- but the problems with Kerberos have only recently surfaced. In this talk we will look back at previous failures in order to look forward. We will take a look at what recent problems in Kerberos mean to your enterprise and ways you could possibly mitigate them. Attacks such as Spoofed-PAC- Pass-the-Hash- Golden Ticket- Pass-the-Ticket and Over-Pass-the-Ticket will be explained. Unfortunately- we don’t really know what is next – only that what we have now is broken.

		* [Abusing Common Cluster Configuration for Lateral Movement](https://www.lares.com/abusing-common-cluster-configuration-privileged-lateral-movement/)
			* Tech sites have published articles that walk a Windows Systems Administrator through the process of adding a machine account to the Local Administrators group on another machine. These accounts end in a $ (dollar sign) and look like SERVER$ in Active Directory. While this may be useful for simplifying the installation of clusters such as Lync, Exchange, or SQL Server, it’s not always the best idea. Servers that are set up in this way weaken the overall security posture of the cluster, and ultimately the organization, by allowing a single vulnerability or misconfiguration on one server the ability to move laterally without having to escalate privileges or compromise additional credentials. Using SQL Server as the example, any user who has READ permissions to a database essentially has SYSTEM-level permissions on a remote server. We’ll walk through that path below.

		* [Pillager](https://github.com/brittonhayes/pillager)
			* Pillager is designed to provide a simple means of leveraging Go's strong concurrency model to recursively search directories for sensitive information in files. Pillager does this by standing on the shoulders of a few giants. Once pillager finds files that match the specified pattern, the file is scanned using a series of concurrent workers that each take a line of the file from the job queue and hunt for sensitive pattern matches. The available pattern filters can be defined in a rules.toml file or you can use the default ruleset.

			* One of the more interesting classes of security vulnerabilities are those affecting interoperability technology. This is because these vulnerabilities typically affect any application using the technology, regardless of what the application actually does. Also in many cases they’re difficult for a developer to mitigate outside of not using that technology, something which isn’t always possible. I discovered one such vulnerability class in the Component Object Model (COM) interoperability layers of .NET which make the use of .NET for Distributed COM (DCOM) across privilege boundaries inherently insecure. This blog post will describe a couple of ways this could be abused, first to gain elevated privileges and then as a remote code execution vulnerability.

			* In this talk we will demonstrate how compiling, reverse engineering or even just viewing source code can lead to compromise of a developer’s workstation. With the emergence of code sharing platforms such as GitHub, it has become common practice to download and view potentially untrusted code. However, due to the way in which integrated development environments for Windows interact with code and the Component Object Model (COM), such behavior can be exploited by attackers to achieve remote code execution. Our research presents full and practical exploit chains for Visual Studio that demonstrate that opening (not running!) code is dangerous. Expect a journey into COM, type libraries and the inner workings of Visual Studio.

				* The COM interface lies at the core of Windows, and subtle registry changes can interfere with this the OS in unexpected ways. COM hijacking allows an attacker to load a library into a calling COM-enabled process. It?s a feature, not a bug. While it is commonly used for persistence, some famous COM hijacks have led to more severe exploits. COM hijacking is already used by several families of malware, and it?s time that pentesters caught up on how to abuse this feature. This presentation will cover COM hijacking from start to finish; showing how discover hijackable COM objects, how to use them offensively, and how to make the calling process remain stable. The blue team will not be forgotten; the talk will cover detection strategies for identifying and defending against COM hijacks.

There are two ways to ensure that your application uses the correct DLL: DLL redirection and side-by-side components. Developers and administrators should use DLL redirection for existing applications, because it does not require any changes to the application. If you are creating a new application or updating an application and want to isolate your application from potential problems, create a side-by-side component.

			* The technique of using memory-based library loading has been around for a number of years. It is available in different forms and for different operating systems. It has been popularized in the security-space with long-standing techniques perhaps even longer than some are aware. And here I thought that I found or did some new evasion. This talk discusses a library for Windows that is still maintained but has been seemingly overlooked for over a decade (or has it?), and how it can be used against the next-generation securing of the digitals.

			* All popular browsers allow users to store sensitive data such as credentials for online and cloud services (such as social networks, email providers, and banking) and forms data (e.g. Credit card number, address, phone number) In Windows environment, most browsers (and many other applications) choose to protect these secrets by using Window Data Protection API (DPAPI), which provides an easy method to encrypt and decrypt secret data. Lately, Mimikatz, a popular pentest/hacking tool, was updated to include a functionality that allows highly-privileged attackers to decrypt all of DPAPI secrets. In this talk, I will analyze the Mimikatz Anti-DPAPI attack targeting the Domain Controller (DC) which puts all DPAPI secrets in peril and show how it can be defeated with network monitoring.

			* Windows credentials manager stores users’ credentials in special folders called vaults. Being able to access such credentials could be truly useful during a digital investigation for example, to gain access to other protected systems. Moreover, if data is in the cloud, there is the need to have the proper tokens to access it. This presentation will describe vaults’ internals and how they can be decrypted; the related Python Open Source code will be made publicly available. During the session, credentials and vaults coming from Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 will be decrypted, focusing on particular cases of interest. Finally, the presentation will address the challenges coming from Windows Phone, such as getting system-users’ passwords and obtaining users’ ActiveSync tokens.

		* [The LaZagne Project](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagneForensic)
			* LaZagne uses an internal Windows function called CryptUnprotectData to decrypt user passwords. This API should be called on the victim user session, otherwise, it does not work. If the computer has not been started (when the analysis is realized on an offline mounted disk), or if we do not want to drop a binary on the remote host, no passwords can be retrieved. LaZagneForensic has been created to avoid this problem. This work has been mainly inspired by the awesome work done by Jean-Michel Picod and Elie Bursztein for DPAPICK and Francesco Picasso for Windows DPAPI laboratory.

			* You’ll learn how to diagnose incredibly complex issues in production systems such as excessive garbage collection pauses, slow startup due to JIT and disk accesses, and even sluggishness during the Windows boot process. We will also explore some ways to automate ETW collection and analysis to build self-diagnosing applications that identify high CPU issues, resource leaks, and concurrency problems and produce alerts and reports. In the course of the talk we will use innovative performance tools that haven’t been applied to ETW before — flame graphs for visualising call stacks and a command-line interface for dynamic, scriptable ETW tracing. ETW is truly a window into everything happening on your system, and it doesn’t require expensive licenses, invasive tools, or modifying your code in any way. It is a critical, first-stop skill on your way to mastering application performance and diagnostics.

Files with a shared common file name extension (.doc, .html, and so on) are of the same type. For example, if you create a new text editor, then you can use the existing .txt file type. In other cases, you might need to create a new file type.

					* "Recently, malicious attacks for Windows operate through Window API hooking in the Windows Kernel. This paper presents the API hooking attack and protection techniques based on Windows kernel. Also this paper develops a detection tool for Windows API hooking that enables to detect dll files which are operated in the kernel. Proposed tool can detect behaviors that imports from dll files or exports to dll files such as kernel32.dll, snmpapi.dll, ntdll.dll and advapidll.dll, etc.. Test results show that the tool can check name, location, and behavior of API in testing system."

In the first step, we go into the basics of the Windows OS architecture. In the second step we take a closer look at two mechanisms which can be used by EPP/EDR products under Windows. Afterwards we look at possibilities how these mechanisms can be bypassed by an attacker. And at the end we also take a short look at what defenders can do to prevent these attacks

			* An access token is an object that describes the security context of a process or thread. The information in a token includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread. When a user logs on, the system verifies the user's password by comparing it with information stored in a security database. If the password is authenticated, the system produces an access token. Every process executed on behalf of this user has a copy of this access token. The system uses an access token to identify the user when a thread interacts with a securable object or tries to perform a system task that requires privileges.

			* UAC, specifically Admin-Approval mode, has been known to be broken ever since it was first released in Windows Vista. Most of the research of bypassing UAC has focused on abusing bad elevated application behavior, auto elevation or shared registry and file resources. However, UAC was fundamentally broken from day one due to the way Microsoft implemented the security around elevated processes, especially their access tokens. This presentation will go into depth on why this technique works, allowing you to silently gain administrator privileges if a single elevated application is running. It will describe how Microsoft tried to fix it in Windows 10, and how you can circumvent their defences. It will also go into detail on a previously undocumented technique to abuse the assumed, more secure, Over-The-Shoulder elevation on Windows 10.

    	    * Imagine a technology that is built into every Windows operating system going back to Windows 95, runs as System, executes arbitrary code, persists across reboots, and does not drop a single file to disk. Such a thing does exist and it's called Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). With increased scrutiny from anti-virus and 'next-gen' host endpoints, advanced red teams and attackers already know that the introduction of binaries into a high-security environment is subject to increased scrutiny. WMI enables an attacker practicing a minimalist methodology to blend into their target environment without dropping a single utility to disk. WMI is also unlike other persistence techniques in that rather than executing a payload at a predetermined time, WMI conditionally executes code asynchronously in response to operating system events. This talk will introduce WMI and demonstrate its offensive uses. We will cover what WMI is, how attackers are currently using it in the wild, how to build a full-featured backdoor, and how to detect and prevent these attacks from occurring.

		* An Evil Maid attack is a security exploit that targets a computing device that has been left unattended. An evil maid attack is characterized by the attacker's ability to physically access the target multiple times without the owner's knowledge. On BlackHat Europe 2015, Ian Haken in his talk "Bypassing Local Windows Authentication to Defeat Full Disk Encryption" had demonstrated a smart Evil Maid attack which allows the attacker to bypass Bitlocker disk encryption in an enterprise's domain environment. The attacker can do so by connecting the unattended computer into a rogue Domain Controller and abusing a client side authentication vulnerability. As a result, Microsoft had released a patch to fix this vulnerability and mitigate the attack. While being a clever attack, the physical access requirement for the attack seems to be prohibitive and would prevent it from being used on most APT campaigns. As a result, defenders might not correctly prioritize the importance of patching it. In our talk, we reveal the "Remote Malicious Butler" attack, which shows how attackers can perform such an attack, remotely, to take a complete control over the remote computer. We will dive into the technical details of the attack including the rogue Domain Controller, the client-side vulnerability and the Kerberos authentication protocol network traffic that ties them. We would explore some other attack avenues, all leveraging on the rogue Domain Controller concept. We would conclude with the analysis of some practical generic detection and prevention methods against rogue Domain Controllers.

				* Abstract—With the rise of attacks using PowerShell in the recent months, there has not been a comprehensive solution for monitoring or prevention. Microsoft recently released the AMSI solution for PowerShell v5, however this can also be bypassed. This paper focuses on repurposing various stealthy runtime .NET hijacking techniques implemented for PowerShell attacks for defensive monitoring of PowerShell. It begins with a brief introduction to .NET and PowerShell, followed by a deeper explanation of various attacker techniques, which is explained from the perspective of the defender, including assembly modification, class and method injection, compiler profiling, and C based function hooking. Of the four attacker techniques that are repurposed for defensive real-time monitoring of PowerShell execution, intermediate language binary modification, JIT hooking, and machine code manipulation provide the best results for stealthy run-time interfaces for PowerShell scripting analysis

			* Abstract—With the rise of attacks using PowerShell in the recent months, there has not been a comprehensive solution for monitoring or prevention. Microsoft recently released the AMSI solution for PowerShell v5, however this can also be bypassed. This paper focuses on repurposing various stealthy runtime .NET hijacking techniques implemented for PowerShell attacks for defensive monitoring of PowerShell. It begins with a brief introduction to .NET and PowerShell, followed by a deeper explanation of various attacker techniques, which is explained from the perspective of the defender, including assembly modification, class and method injection, compiler profiling, and C based function hooking. Of the four attacker techniques that are repurposed for defensive real-time monitoring of PowerShell execution, intermediate language binary modification, JIT hooking, and machine code manipulation provide the best results for stealthy run-time interfaces for PowerShell scripting analysis

			* SharpNado is proof of concept tool that demonstrates how one could use .Net Remoting or Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to host smarter and dynamic .NET payloads.  SharpNado is not meant to be a full functioning, robust, payload delivery system nor is it anything groundbreaking. It's merely something to get the creative juices flowing on how one could use these technologies or others to create dynamic and hopefully smarter payloads. I have provided a few simple examples of how this could be used to either dynamically execute base64 assemblies in memory or dynamically compile source code and execute it in memory.  This, however, could be expanded upon to include different kinds of stagers, payloads, protocols, etc.

		* [Staying # & Bringing Covert Injection Tradecraft to .NET - The Wover, Ruben Boonen(BlueHat IL 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuxpMXTgV9s&feature=share)
			* As .NET has taken over as the preferred platform for development on Windows, many attackers have chosen to take advantage of its features for post-exploitation tradecraft. Legitimate APIs can be leveraged for nearly every imaginable task, managed code can be loaded and executed from memory with extraordinary ease, and scalable monitoring for suspicious usage of .NET APIs is a problem yet to be solved. However, offensive .NET tools are still hindered by a fundamental weakness: the inability to leverage unmanaged code (such as the Win32/NT APIs) safe from observation by EDR. Managed code must eventually invoke unmanaged code in order to interface with the operating system. It is here that the attacker may be caught in the hooks of any system keen on watching for fundamentally malicious behavior. To expose the depth of tradecraft still unexplored in .NET and highlight the fragility of many existing detections, we will detail the tools we have built for evading these hooks. All of our efforts have been integrated into SharpSploit, a .NET post-exploitation library written in C# that aims to highlight the attack surface of .NET and make the use of offensive .NET easier for red teamers. Over the past few months we have added numerous new tools and techniques for loading and executing unmanaged code safely from .NET. Unmanaged APIs may be safely accessed and modules loaded either from memory or from disk in the new DInvoke API, a dynamic replacement for .NET's PInvoke API. It also includes manual mapping, a generic syscall wrapper, a new technique we call Module Overloading, and more. Additionally, we have added a modular process injection API that allows tool developers to build their own injection technique. Simply select an allocation and injection primitive, pass in any options, and execute the result with your preferred payload. This exposes all possible design decisions to the user, and allows for easy adaptation when existing tools fail. In our talk we will focus on explaining the fundamental tradecraft behind these new developments, the challenges and requirements associated with them, and how they can be adapted to suit your needs. Additionally, we will discuss how SharpSploit can be combined with other open-source projects to be integrated into a red team's tooling. As much as possible, we will also discuss how to counter and detect the techniques that we have developed. Finally, we will explain the community-focused development of these projects and how you too can contribute to advance open-source .NET tradecraft

This is the most OpSec friendly way to load Assemblies, since it is bootstrapped by an unmanaged executable (and is therefore harder to reverse) and does not use any .NET Framework libraries (such as System.Reflection). Because the result is an unmanaged PE-formatted EXE or DLL, the result may be injected into processes using standard process injection techniques. Therefore, managed Assemblies may be injected into unmanaged processes. Additionally, unmanaged on-disk stagers (written in C/C++) may be built that load .NET payloads (written in C#, etc.).

This is a reliable technique and does not modify the size of resulting binary; Alterations: Instructions are swapped with functional equivalents, effectively de-optimizing them. New instructions are inserted into the same graph used by the Shuffling technique, allowing them to be reordered as well.

			* Quick Retooling in .Net for Red Teams PowerShell gave us a super-highway of convenient building blocks for offensive toolkits and operational automation. However, use of standalone .Net implants may be a desirable option in cases where PowerShell is heavily inspected and logged. While there are great toolkits to invoke unmanaged PowerShell or directly interface with .Net CLR - they are also statically compiled, and therefore easier identified by the defense. Red Teams are faced with specific challenges when they need to retool quickly in the field with .Net payloads. Can .Net toolkits accomplish their goals while maintaining flexibility, quick in-field retooling and operational security in the face of current detection mechanisms? We think so. This talk walks through some of the options present to the operators for .Net code compilation and presents ideas for extensibility of .Net tools at runtime, with the help of Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). We will dive deeper into operational security lessons learned from dynamic code compilation. We will attempt to move beyond static nature of .Net assemblies into reflective DLR, achieving on-the-fly access to native Windows API. We will also discuss some methods of hiding sensitive aspects of execution in managed code memory. We will also touch on ways to help Defense fingerprint the attacks involving dynamic compilation of .Net assemblies, use of DLR and building blocks of offensive tooling involved in the process. A concept tool built on these ideas will be presented and released. It will be used as basis for our discussion.

		* Quite often, you may have heard people mention, “Why should you bother learning PowerShell, isn’t it dead?” or “Why not just use C#?” Many individuals in the offensive security field have a common misconception that PowerShell is obsolete for red team operations. Meanwhile, it remains one of the primary attack vectors employed by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APTs are known for implementing sophisticated hacking tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to gain access to a system for an extended period of time. Their actions typically focus on high-value targets, which leave potentially crippling consequences to both nation-states and corporations. It is crucial that Red Teams accurately emulate real-world threats and do not ignore viable attack options. For this talk, we will walk through how many threat actors adapt and employ PowerShell tools. Our discussion begins with examining how script block logging and AMSI are powerful anti-offensive PowerShell measures. However, the implementation of script block logging places a technical burden on organizations to conduct auditing on a substantial amount of data. While AMSI is trivial to bypass for any capable adversary. Finally, we will demonstrate APT-like PowerShell techniques that remain incredibly effective against the latest generation of network defenses.

In this session, we will demonstrate how to enhance capabilities provided by AMSI and how to overcome its limitations, through a realistic implementation of the technique, all while analyzing the internals of .NET Framework and the PowerShell engine. 
		    * [Defensive Coding Strategies for a High-Security Environment - Matt Graeber - PowerShell Conference EU 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=O1lglnNTM18)
        		* How sure are you that your PowerShell code is prepared to handle anything that a user might throw at it? What if the user was an attacker attempting to circumvent security controls by exploiting a vulnerability in your script? This may sound unrealistic but this is a legitimate concern of the PowerShell team when including PowerShell code in the operating system. In a high-security environment where strict AppLocker or Device Guard rules are deployed, PowerShell exposes a large attack surface that can be used to circumvent security controls. While constrained language mode goes a long way in preventing malicious PowerShell code from executing, attackers will seek out vulnerabilities in trusted signed code in order to circumvent security controls. This talk will cover numerous different ways in which attackers can influence the execution of your code in unanticipated ways. A thorough discussion of mitigations against such attacks will then follow.

				* This repository is based on a post by [@xpn](https://twitter.com/_xpn_), [more details available here.](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2018/09/applocker-clm-bypass-via-com/) Xpn's post outlines a bug of sorts where ConstrainedLanguage, when enforced through AppLocker does not prevent COM invocation. Because of this it is possible to define a custom COM object in the registry and force PowerShell to load a Dll. On load it is possible to change the LanguageMode to FullLanguage and break out of the restricted shell. This repo is a variation on this technique where a DotNetToJScript scriptlet is used to directly stage a .Net assembly into the PowerShell process.

				* Running into environments where the use of PowerShell is being monitored or is just flat-out disabled? Have you tried out the fantastic PowerOps framework but are wishing you could use something similar via Meterpreter, Empire, or other C2 channels? Look no further! In this talk, Brian Fehrman talks about his new PowerLine framework. He overviews the tool, walks you through how to use it, shows you how you can add additional PowerShell scripts with little effort, and demonstrates just how powerful (all pun intended) this little program can be!

It enables you to run almost any command that exists on a remote computer, opening up a universe of possibilities for bulk and remote administration. Remoting underpins other technologies, including Workflow, Desired State Configuration, certain types of background jobs, and much more. This guide isn't intended to be a complete document of what Remoting is and does, although it does provide a good introduction. Instead, this guide is designed to document all the little configuration details that don't appear to be documented elsewhere.

			* It used to be that most people were just starting to hear about PowerShell. Over the last 3 years, this has changed dramatically. We now see Offensive and Defensive PowerShell tools, exploits specifically leveraging PowerShell and WMI, and more organizations are starting to be intentional for detection and monitoring of PowerShell scripts and commands. With this visibility, it is becoming a game of cat and mouse to leverage and detect PowerShell. In this talk, I will highlight some secrets I use to ensure my PowerShell exploits are successful and some unique tactics which will bypass common defensive controls. I will also walk you through the creation of a custom PowerShell C# DLL which you can use to compromise your target. If you want to code with me, be sure to bring a laptop with Visual Studio 2013 or later installed.
		* [Goodbye Obfuscation, Hello Invisi Shell: Hiding Your Powershell Script in Plain Sight - Omer Yair(Derbycon2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3oMEiySxcc)
			* “The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world. Lies will pass into history.” George Orwell. Objective truth is essential for security. Logs, notifications and saved data must reflect the actual events for security tools, forensic teams and IT managers to perform their job correctly. Powershell is a prime example of the constant cat and mouse game hackers and security personnel play every day to either reveal or hide the “objective truth” of a running script. Powershell’s auto logging, obfuscation techniques, AMSI and more are all participants of the same game playing by the same rules. We don’t like rules, so we broke them. As a result, Babel-Shellfish and Invisi-Shelltwo new tools that both expose and disguise powershell scripts were born. Babel-Shellfish reveals the inner hidden code of any obfuscated script while Invisi-Shell offers a new method of hiding malicious scripts, even from the Powershell process running it. Join us as we present a new way to think about scripts.

				* Defeating The Latest Advances in Script Obfuscation Mark Mager Mark Mager - @magerbomb In this age of increasingly sophisticated and devastating malware, adversaries still rely on a multitude of scripting languages and frameworks (e.g. JavaScript, VBA, PowerShell, VBScript) as key components of an attack scenario. These scripts tend to employ obfuscation techniques in order to obscure their true intent and avoid detection by endpoint protection products. Though significant advances have been made in recent years in packing and obfuscating compiled binaries, script obfuscation can still be defeated with time and a determined analyst. This talk will cover some of the most recently seen advanced obfuscation techniques employed by APTs, exploit kits, and other malware authors along with proven methods for circumventing and decoding these techniques. I will then apply these methods to guide the audience through the deobfuscation of a fully obfuscated script. Audience members will walk away with a solid understanding of how common obfuscation techniques are employed in scripting languages along with how they can be defeated.

				* Attackers, administrators and many legitimate products rely on PowerShell for their core functionality. However, its power has made it increasingly attractive for attackers and commodity malware authors alike. How do you separate the good from the bad? A/V signatures applied to command line arguments work sometimes. AMSI-based (Anti-malware Scan Interface) detection performs significantly better. But obfuscation and evasion techniques like Invoke-Obfuscation can and do bypass both approaches. Revoke-Obfuscation is a framework that transforms evasion into a treacherous deceit. By applying a suite of unique statistical analysis techniques against PowerShell scripts and their structures, what was once a cloak of invisibility is now a spotlight. It works with .evtx files, command lines, scripts, ScriptBlock logs, Module logs, and is easy to extend. Approaches for evading these detection techniques will be discussed and demonstrated. Revoke-Obfuscation has been used in numerous Mandiant investigations to successfully identify obfuscated and non-obfuscated malicious PowerShell scripts and commands. It also detects all obfuscation techniques in Invoke-Obfuscation, including two new techniques being released with this presentation.

			* In this talk we present a code injection technique, dubbed AtomBombing, which exploits Windows atom tables and Async Procedure Calls (APC). At the time of its release (October 2016), AtomBombing went undetected by common security solutions that focused on preventing infiltration.  AtomBombing affects all Windows versions. In particular, we tested it against Windows 10 and Windows 7.   Unfortunately, this issue cannot be patched by Microsoft since it doesn’t rely on broken or flawed code – rather on how these operating system mechanisms are designed.

	        * This talk will focus on detecting reflective injection with some mildly humorous notes and bypassing said protections until vendors start actually working on this problem. It seems amazing that reflective injection still works. Why is that? Because programmers are lazy. They don't want to write new engines, they want to write definitions for an engine that already exists. So what do we do about it? Release a $5 tool that does what $50 AV has failed epically at for several years now...oh and it took me a week or so...Alternately, you could license it to vendors since their programmers are lazy.

			* Reflective DLL injection is a library injection technique in which the concept of reflective programming is employed to perform the loading of a library from memory into a host process. As such the library is responsible for loading itself by implementing a minimal Portable Executable (PE) file loader. It can then govern, with minimal interaction with the host system and process, how it will load and interact with the host.

			* Detecting certain user-mode code-hiding techniques, such as Josh Lospinoso's 'Gargoyle', is almost impossible from user-space. In this talk, I will examine Gargoyle, and explain how it can be detected from kernel mode. I will first walk through using WinDbg to locate hidden code and then write a Volatility plugin to turn this process into a practical method of detecting real-world attacks — in the process, adding a reliable method of differentiating these from legitimate behavior. No prior kernel knowledge is needed, but those with a background in WinDbg, Windows internals, forensics, and/or Volatility will get the most from this talk.

			* The use of memory forensics is becoming commonplace in digital investigation and incident response, as it provides critically important capabilities for detecting sophisticated malware attacks, including memory-only malware components. In this paper, we concentrate on improving analysis of API hooks, a technique commonly employed by malware to hijack the execution flow of legitimate functions. These hooks allow the malware to gain control at critical times and to exercise complete control over function arguments and return values. Existing techniques for detecting hooks, such the Volatility plugin apihooks, do a credible job, but generate numerous false positives related to non-malicious use of API hooking. Furthermore, deeper analysis to determine the nature of hooks detected by apihooks typically requires substantial skill in reverse engineering and an extensive knowledge of operating systems internals. In this paper, we present a new, highly configurable tool called hooktracer, which eliminates false positives, provides valuable insight into the operation of detected hooks, and generates portable signatures called hook traces, which can be used to rapidly investigate large numbers of machines for signs of malware infection.
		* [Hunting for Ghosts in Fileless Attacks - Buddy Tancio(2019)](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/malicious/paper/38960)
			* Hunting for a fileless threat can be a tedious and labor-intensive task for any analyst. It is, most often than not, extremely time-consuming and requires a significant amount of data gathering. On top of that, the traditional tools, methods, and defenses seem to be less effective when dealing with these almost invisible threats. Threat actors are frequently using attack techniques that work directly from the memory or using legitimate tools or services pre-installed in the system to achieve their goals (Trend Micro, 2017). It is a popular technique among targeted attacks and advanced persistent threats (APT), and now it has been adopted by conventional malware such as trojans, ransomwares, and even the most recent emerging threat – cryptocurrency miners. In some incidents, searching for a malicious file that resides in the hard drive seems to be insufficient. This study explores the different variations of fileless attacks that targeted the Windows operating system and what kind of artifacts or tools can provide clues for forensic investigation.

			* Process hollowing is yet another tool in the kit of those who seek to hide the presence of a process. The idea is rather straight forward: a bootstrap application creates a seemingly innocent process in a suspended state. The legitimate image is then unmapped and replaced with the image that is to be hidden. If the preferred image base of the new image does not match that of the old image, the new image must be rebased. Once the new image is loaded in memory the EAX register of the suspended thread is set to the entry point. The process is then resumed and the entry point of the new image is executed.

			* Malware authors are always looking for new ways to achieve code injection, as it enables them to run their code in remote processes. Code Injection allows hackers to better hide their presence, gain persistence and leverage other processes’ data and privileges. Finding and implementing new, stable methods for code injection is becoming more and more challenging as traditional techniques are now widely detected by various security solutions or limited by native OS protections.  Inject-Me is a new method to inject code into a remote process in x64. Inject-Me is in fact “injection-less”, meaning that the remote (target) process is manipulated to read data from the injecting process, copy and execute it. The manipulation is mainly based on abusing ReadProcessMemory and calling conventions in X64. In addition to presenting Inject-Me, we mention a generalized approach to copying data in remote processes to recreate shellcode from the injecting process.

		* create a standard Windows process in a suspended state, write our malicious code to the processes’ memory; the PEB and the EPROCESS structures will still be that of the original process, causing the HIPS to see the now malicious process as a legitimate signed executable (this is not RunPE or dynamic forking, because we don’t unmap the original executable and replacing it with our malicious one, as thos can be detected in multiple ways).

Edit : This method is not new, apparently it have been using by game cheats for years, but instead of using ZwUnmapViewOfSection they use FreeLibrary.
